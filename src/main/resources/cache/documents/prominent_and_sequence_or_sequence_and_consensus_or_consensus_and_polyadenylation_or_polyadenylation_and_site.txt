The most prominent uricase-producing bacterium was identified as Comamonas sp BT UA. Crude enzyme was extracted, freeze-dried and its Km and Vmax were determined as 40 meu M and 0.047 meu M min-1ml-1 using Line-weaver Burke plot. An activity of 80 U/mg of total protein was observed when cultured at 37 degree C for 84 h at pH 7. The purified enzyme was used to measure uric acid by spectrophotometric method and electrochemical biosensor. In the biosensing system the enzyme was immobilized on the platinum electrode with a biodegradable glutaraldehyde-crosslinked gelatin film having a swelling percentage of 109+/- 3.08, and response was observed by amperometry applying fixed potential. The electrochemical process as obtained by the anodic peak current and scan rate relationship was further configured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The polymer matrix on the working electrode gave capacitive response for the electrode-electrolyte interaction. The sensitivity of the biosensor was measured as 6.93 meu A meu M -1 with a sensor affinity [Km(app)] of 50 mu M and 95 percent reproducibility after 50 measurements. The spectrophotometric method could be used in the range of 6-1000 mu M, whereas the biosensor generated linear response in the 1.5- 1000 mu M range with a response time of 24 s and limit of detection of 0.56 meu M.

While this maintains the quality of most fruit, occasionally storage disorders such as flesh browning can occur. This study aimed to explore changes in the apple transcriptome associated with a flesh browning disorder related to controlled atmosphere storage using RNA-sequencing techniques. Samples from a browning-susceptible cultivar (`Braeburn¿) were stored for four months under controlled atmosphere. Based on a visual browning index, the inner and outer cortex of the stored apples was classified as healthy or affected tissue.ResultsOver 600 million short single-end reads were mapped onto the Malus consensus coding sequence set, and differences in the expression profiles between healthy and affected tissues were assessed to identify candidate genes associated with internal browning in a tissue-specific manner. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, and cell wall modifications were highly modified in the affected inner cortex, while energy-related and stress-related genes were mostly altered in the outer cortex. The expression levels of several of them were confirmed using qRT-PCR. Additionally, a set of novel browning-specific differentially expressed genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, was validated in apples stored for various periods at different controlled atmosphere conditions, giving rise to potential biomarkers associated with high risk of browning development.ConclusionsThe gene expression data presented in this study will help elucidate the molecular mechanism of browning development in apples at controlled atmosphere storage. A conceptual model, including energy-related (linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain) and lipid-related genes (related to membrane alterations, and fatty acid oxidation), for browning development in apple is proposed, which may be relevant for future studies towards improving the postharvest life of apple.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC plant

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The coupling of transcription and associated processes has been shown to be dependent on RNA Polymerase II's (RNAPII) C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) and the phosphorylation of the heptad repeats of which it is composed (consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7). Two primary S2 position CTD kinases have been identified in higher eukaryotes: P-TEFb and CDK12/CyclinK. The more recently discovered CDK12 appears to act at the 3' end of the transcription unit and has been identified as a tumor suppressor for ovarian cancer; however much is still unknown about the in vivo roles of CDK12/CyclinK. In an effort to further characterize these roles we have purified to near homogeneity and characterized, full-length, active, human CDK12/CyclinK and identified hCDK12 associated proteins via mass spectrometry. We find that employing a \"2A\" peptide-linked multicistronic construct containing CDK12 and CyclinK results in the efficient production of active, recombinant enzyme in the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. Using GST-CTD fusion protein substrates we find that CDK12/CyclinK prefers a substrate with unmodified repeats or one that mimics prephosphorylation at the S7 position of the CTD; also the enzyme is sensitive to the inhibitor flavopiridol at higher concentrations. Identification of CDK12-associating proteins reveals a strong enrichment for RNA processing factors suggesting that CDK12 affects RNA processing events in two distinct ways: Indirectly through generating factor-binding phospho-epitopes on the CTD of elongating RNAPII and directly through binding to specific factors.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Activation","uri":{"id":"D004789","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Activators","uri":{"id":"D020536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Activities","uri":{"id":"D006802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ovarian Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mass Spectrometry","uri":{"id":"D013058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Activators","uri":{"id":"D020536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases","uri":{"id":"D012321","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphorylation","uri":{"id":"D010766","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphotransferases","uri":{"id":"D010770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrum Analysis","uri":{"id":"D013057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Baculoviridae","uri":{"id":"D016367","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B","uri":{"id":"D042925","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429106","title":"Expression, Purification, and Identification of Associated Proteins of the Full Length hCDK12/CyclinK Complex.","year":"2014"}

However, accurately detecting SV using high-throughput sequencing data remains challenging, especially for 'targeted' resequencing efforts. This is critically important in the clinical setting where targeted resequencing is frequently being applied to rapidly assess clinically actionable mutations in tumor biopsies in a cost-effective manner. We present BreaKmer, a novel approach that uses a 'kmer' strategy to assemble misaligned sequence reads for predicting insertions, deletions, inversions, tandem duplications and translocations at base-pair resolution in targeted resequencing data. Variants are predicted by realigning an assembled consensus sequence created from sequence reads that were abnormally aligned to the reference genome. Using targeted resequencing data from tumor specimens with orthogonally validated SV, non-tumor samples and whole-genome sequencing data, BreaKmer had a 97.4% overall sensitivity for known events and predicted 17 positively validated, novel variants. Relative to four publically available algorithms, BreaKmer detected SV with increased sensitivity and limited calls in non-tumor samples, key features for variant analysis of tumor specimens in both the clinical and research settings.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomedical Research","uri":{"id":"D035843","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","uri":{"id":"D059014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomic Structural Variation","uri":{"id":"D056914","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biopsy","uri":{"id":"D001706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reading","uri":{"id":"D011932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428359","title":"BreaKmer: detection of structural variation in targeted massively parallel sequencing data using kmers.","year":"2014"}

In recent years phylogenetic data sets have expanded from single genes to genome wide markers comprising hundreds to thousands of loci. Processing of these large phylogenomic data sets is impracticable without using automated process pipelines. Currently no stand-alone or pipeline compatible program exists that offers a broad range of manipulation and processing steps for multiple sequence alignments in a single process run. RESULTS: Here we present FASconCAT-G, a system independent editor, which offers various processing options for multiple sequence alignments. The software provides a wide range of possibilities to edit and concatenate multiple nucleotide, amino acid, and structure sequence alignment files for phylogenetic and population genetic purposes. The main options include sequence renaming, file format conversion, sequence translation between nucleotide and amino acid states, consensus generation of specific sequence blocks, sequence concatenation, model selection of amino acid replacement with ProtTest, two types of RY coding as well as site exclusions and extraction of parsimony informative sites. Convieniently, most options can be invoked in combination and performed during a single process run. Additionally, FASconCAT-G prints useful information regarding alignment characteristics and editing processes such as base compositions of single in- and outfiles, sequence areas in a concatenated supermatrix, as well as paired stem and loop regions in secondary structure sequence strings.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a new magnetic resonance imaging sequence that is extremely sensitive in hemorrhage detection and that might improve the detection of hemorrhages over time. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the detectability of intracranial blood and its degradation products is independent of the time span after intracranial hemorrhage using SWI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients (28 men, 38 women) with definitely known time point of intracranial hemorrhage and available SWI sequence (1.5 or 3 T) were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-one patients had a SWI follow-up. All SWI images were assessed by two radiologists in consensus regarding hemorrhage visibility using a 5-point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: Median time interval between hemorrhage and first available SWI measurement was 819 days (range, 0 days to 13.2 years). Nine of 66 patients had an isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage (iSAH) and were therefore analyzed separately. In eight of these nine patients the hemorrhage could clearly be detected, the remaining one had minor iSAH. Spearman analysis showed no significant correlation between time span and visibility (P = 0.660). In the remaining 57 patients (no iSAH) the hemorrhage was always visible achieving at least 3/5 points on the 5-point scale, and Spearman's analysis revealed only a weak correlation between time span and visibility (r = 0.493, P < 0.001).

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Chronic HCV is a surreptitious disease currently affecting approximately 3% of the world's population that can lead to liver failure and cancer decades following initial infection. However, there are currently no vaccines available for the prevention of chronic HCV. From patients who acutely resolve HCV infection, it is apparent that a strong and broad cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is important in HCV clearance. DNA vaccines are naked plasmid DNA molecules that encode pathogen antigens to induce a pathogen-specific immune response. They are inexpensive to produce and have an excellent safety profile in animals and humans. Additionally, DNA vaccines are able to induce strong CTL responses, making them well-suited for an HCV vaccine. We aimed to maximize vaccine recipients' opportunity to induce a broad T cell response with a novel antigenic sequence, multi-antigen vaccine strategy. We have generated DNA plasmids encoding consensus sequences of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b non-structural proteins NS3/4a, NS4b, NS5a, and NS5b. Rhesus macaques were used to study the immunogenicity of these constructs. Four animals were immunized 3 times, 6 weeks apart, at a dose of 1.0mg per antigen construct, as an intramuscular injection followed by in vivo electroporation, which greatly increases DNA uptake by local cells. Immune responses were measured 2 weeks post-immunization regimen (PIR) in immunized rhesus macaques and showed a broad response to multiple HCV nonstructural antigens, with up to 4680 spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as measured by Interferon-γ ELISpot. In addition, multiparametric flow cytometry detected HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining and detected HCV-specific CD107a+/GrzB+ CD8+ T cells indicating an antigen specific cytolytic response 2 weeks PIR compared with baseline measurements. At the final study time point, 6 weeks PIR, HCV-specific CD45RA- memory-like T cells remained detectable in peripheral blood. Data presented in this manuscript support the notion that vaccine immunogenicity studies using a macaque model can be used to depict key anti-HCV nonstructural antigenic cellular immune responses and support the development of DNA-based prophylactic HCV vaccines.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Human vaccines &

We have assembled a high-density tetraploid wheat consensus map by integrating 13 data sets from independent biparental populations involving durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum), cultivated emmer (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) and their ancestor (wild emmer, T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides). The consensus map harboured 30 144 markers (including 26 626 SNPs and 791 SSRs) half of which were present in at least two component maps. The final map spanned 2631 cM of all 14 durum wheat chromosomes and, differently from the individual component maps, all markers fell within the 14 linkage groups. Marker density per genetic distance unit peaked at centromeric regions, likely due to a combination of low recombination rate in the centromeric regions and even gene distribution along the chromosomes. Comparisons with bread wheat indicated fewer regions with recombination suppression, making this consensus map valuable for mapping in the A and B genomes of both durum and bread wheat. Sequence similarity analysis allowed us to relate mapped gene-derived SNPs to chromosome-specific transcripts. Dense patterns of homeologous relationships have been established between the A- and B-genome maps and between nonsyntenic homeologous chromosome regions as well, the latter tracing to ancient translocation events. The gene-based homeologous relationships are valuable to infer the map location of homeologs of target loci/QTLs. Because most SNP and SSR markers were previously mapped in bread wheat, this consensus map will facilitate a more effective integration and exploitation of genes and QTL for wheat breeding purposes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Plant biotechnology journal","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosome Mapping","uri":{"id":"D002874","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triticum","uri":{"id":"D014908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recombination, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D011995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Centromere","uri":{"id":"D002503","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triticum","uri":{"id":"D014908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tetraploidy","uri":{"id":"D057891","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424506","title":"A high-density, SNP-based consensus map of tetraploid wheat as a bridge to integrate durum and bread wheat genomics and breeding.","year":"2014"}

The essential splicing factor U2AF(65) normally recognizes a Py tract consensus sequence preceding the major class of 3' splice sites. We found that neurofibromatosis- or retinitis pigmentosa-causing mutations in the 5' regions of Py tracts severely reduce U2AF(65) affinity. Conversely, we identified a preferred binding site of U2AF(65) for purine substitutions in the 3' regions of Py tracts. Based on a comparison of new U2AF(65) structures bound to either A- or G-containing Py tracts with previously identified pyrimidine-containing structures, we expected to find that a D231V amino acid change in U2AF(65) would specify U over other nucleotides. We found that the crystal structure of the U2AF(65)-D231V variant confirms favorable packing between the engineered valine and a target uracil base. The D231V amino acid change restores U2AF(65) affinity for two mutated splice sites that cause human genetic diseases and successfully promotes splicing of a defective retinitis pigmentosa-causing transcript. We conclude that reduced U2AF(65) binding is a molecular consequence of disease-relevant mutations, and that a structure-guided U2AF(65) variant is capable of manipulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryotic Cells","uri":{"id":"D005057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetics, Medical","uri":{"id":"D005826","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splice Sites","uri":{"id":"D022821","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retinaldehyde","uri":{"id":"D012172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retinitis","uri":{"id":"D012173","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurofibromatoses","uri":{"id":"D017253","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Purines","uri":{"id":"D011687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Precursors","uri":{"id":"D012322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uracil","uri":{"id":"D014498","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Valine","uri":{"id":"D014633","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422459","title":"Structure-guided U2AF65 variant improves recognition and splicing of a defective pre-mRNA.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: CGI-58/ABHD5 co-activates adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). In adipocytes, CGI-58 binds to perilipin 1A on lipid droplets under basal conditions, preventing interaction with ATGL. Upon activation of protein kinase A (PKA), perilipin 1A is phosphorylated and CGI-58 rapidly disperses into the cytoplasm, enabling lipase co-activation. Since the amino acid sequence of murine CGI-58 has a predicted PKA consensus sequence of RKYS239S240, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of CGI-58 is involved in this process. We show that Ser239 of murine CGI-58 is a substrate for PKA using phosphoamino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting approaches to study phosphorylation of recombinant CGI-58 and endogenous CGI-58 of adipose tissue. Phosphorylation of CGI-58 neither increased nor impaired co-activation of ATGL in vitro. Moreover, Ser239 was not required for CGI-58 function to increase triacylglycerol turnover in human neutral lipid storage disorder fibroblasts that lack endogenous CGI-58. Both CGI-58 and S239A/S240A mutated CGI-58 localized to perilipin 1A-coated lipid droplets in cells. When PKA was activated, WT CGI-58 dispersed into the cytoplasm, whereas substantial S239A/S240A-mutated CGI-58 remained on lipid droplets. Perilipin phosphorylation also contributed to CGI-58 dispersion.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The rnp-4f gene in Drosophila melanogaster encodes nuclear protein RNP-4F. This encoded protein is represented by homologs in other eukaryotic species, where it has been shown to function as an intron splicing assembly factor. Here, RNP-4F is believed to initially bind to a recognition sequence on U6-snRNA, serving as a chaperone to facilitate its association with U4-snRNA by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. RNA conformations are a key factor in spliceosome function, so that elucidation of changing secondary structures for interacting snRNAs is a subject of considerable interest and importance. Among the five snRNAs which participate in removal of spliceosomal introns, there is a growing consensus that U6-snRNA is the most structurally dynamic and may constitute the catalytic core. Previous studies by others have generated potential secondary structures for free U4- and U6-snRNAs, including the Y-shaped U4-/U6-snRNA model. These models were based on study of RNAs from relatively few species, and the popular Y-shaped model remains to be systematically re-examined with reference to the many new sequences generated by recent genomic sequencing projects. We have utilized a comparative phylogenetic approach on 60 diverse eukaryotic species, which resulted in a revised and improved U4-/U6-snRNA secondary structure. This general model is supported by observation of abundant compensatory base mutations in every stem, and incorporates more of the nucleotides into base-paired associations than in previous models, thus being more energetically stable. We have extensively sampled the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree to its deepest roots, but did not find genes potentially encoding either U4- or U6-snRNA in the Giardia and Trichomonas data-bases. Our results support the hypothesis that nuclear introns in these most deeply rooted eukaryotes may represent evolutionary intermediates, sharing characteristics of both group II and spliceosomal introns. An unexpected result of this study was discovery of a potential competitive binding site for Drosophila splicing assembly factor RNP-4F to a 5'-UTR regulatory region within its own premRNA, which may play a role in negative feedback control.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Open journal of animal

Due to their conformational flexibility they are often found to interact with a multitude of protein molecules; this one-to-many interaction which is vital for their versatile functioning involves short consensus protein sequences, which are normally detected using slow and cumbersome experimental procedures. In this work we exploit information from disorder-oriented protein interaction networks focused specifically on humans, in order to assemble, by means of overrepresentation, a set of sequence patterns that mediate the functioning of disordered proteins; hence, we are able to identify how a single protein achieves such functional promiscuity. Next, we study the sequential characteristics of the extracted patterns, which exhibit a striking preference towards a very limited subset of amino acids; specifically, residues leucine, glutamic acid, and serine are particularly frequent among the extracted patterns, and we also observe a nontrivial propensity towards alanine and glycine. Furthermore, based on the extracted patterns we set off to infer potential functional implications in order to verify our findings and potentially further extrapolate our knowledge regarding the functioning of disordered proteins. We observe that the extracted patterns are primarily involved with regulation, binding and posttranslational modifications, which constitute the most prominent functions of disordered proteins.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiovascular Diseases","uri":{"id":"D002318","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Processing, Post-Translational","uri":{"id":"D011499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","uri":{"id":"D019636","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamates","uri":{"id":"D005971","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamic Acid","uri":{"id":"D018698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Interaction Maps","uri":{"id":"D060066","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamates","uri":{"id":"D005971","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitalism","uri":{"id":"D014799","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pliability","uri":{"id":"D018583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamic Acid","uri":{"id":"D018698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044382","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alanine","uri":{"id":"D000409","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glycine","uri":{"id":"D005998","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leucine","uri":{"id":"D007930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417015","title":"Sequence patterns mediating functions of disordered proteins.","year":"2015"}

Most tools only predict potential splice sites given a DNA sequence without measuring splicing signal changes caused by a variant. Another limitation is the lack of large-scale evaluation studies of these tools. We compared eight in silico tools on 2959 single nucleotide variants within splicing consensus regions (scSNVs) using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The Position Weight Matrix model and MaxEntScan outperformed other methods. Two ensemble learning methods, adaptive boosting and random forests, were used to construct models that take advantage of individual methods. Both models further improved prediction, with outputs of directly interpretable prediction scores. We applied our ensemble scores to scSNVs from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. Analysis showed that predicted splice-altering scSNVs are enriched in recurrent scSNVs and known cancer genes.

Currently the worst Ebola virus outbreak since the disease was discovered is occurring in West Africa. Although thought to be a zoonotic infection, a concern is that with increasing numbers of humans being infected, Ebola virus variants could be selected which are better adapted for human-to-human transmission.ResultsTo investigate whether genetic changes in Ebola virus become established in response to adaptation in a different host, a guinea pig model of infection was used. In this experimental system, guinea pigs were infected with Ebola virus (EBOV), which initially did not cause disease. To simulate transmission to uninfected individuals, the virus was serially passaged five times in naive animals. As the virus was passaged, virulence increased and clinical effects were observed in the guinea pig. An RNAseq and consensus mapping approach was then used to evaluate potential nucleotide changes in the Ebola virus genome at each passage.ConclusionsUpon passage in the guinea pig model, EBOV become more virulent, RNA editing and also coding changes in key proteins become established. The data suggest that the initial evolutionary trajectory of EBOV in a new host can lead to a gain in virulence. Given the circumstances of the sustained transmission of EBOV in the current outbreak in West Africa, increases in virulence may be associated with prolonged and uncontrolled epidemics of EBOV.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Genome biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Zoonoses","uri":{"id":"D015047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Africa, Western","uri":{"id":"D000354","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Guinea Pigs","uri":{"id":"D006168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Satellite Viruses","uri":{"id":"D012526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serial Passage","uri":{"id":"D012692","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Viral","uri":{"id":"D016679","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Editing","uri":{"id":"D017393","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ebolavirus","uri":{"id":"D029043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Africa","uri":{"id":"D000349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease Outbreaks","uri":{"id":"D004196","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hemorrhage","uri":{"id":"D006470","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Viruses","uri":{"id":"D014780","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epidemics","uri":{"id":"D058872","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416632","title":"Elucidating variations in the nucleotide sequence of Ebola virus associated with increasing pathogenicity.","year":"2014"}

Lotus japonicus NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is an essential factor that specifically and positively regulates nodulation processes, and has been evolved from a member of NIN-like proteins, of which Arabidopsis homologs target nitrate-responsive elements (NREs), and activate gene expression in response to nitrate. It is therefore assumed that the NIN-mediated transcriptional network overlaps with those regulated by NLPs, because of their common DNA-binding RWP-RK domains. However, nodulation is inhibited in the presence of nitrate, and involvement of NIN in nitrate-responses has remained largely unknown. Here we determined a consensus of NIN-binding nucleotide sequences (NBSs) by in vitro experiments, and revealed that the sequence pattern was very similar to those of NREs. ChIP-PCR analyses showed that NIN targeted NREs in L. japonicus nitrate-inducible gene promoters, including LjNIR1, LjNRT2.1, and LjNIR2.2. Affinities of NIN-binding to the NREs were comparable to that to NBS-yB1a, a NBS on the symbiotic LjNF-YB1 promoter, indicating that NREs are potential targets of NIN. However, rhizobial infection did not activate LjNIR1, LjNRT2.1, and LjNIR2.2. NIN ectopic expression interfered with nitrate-dependent activation of these genes. Nitrate treatment followed by NIN activation downregulated expression of symbiotic NIN-target genes. Our results showed that NIN and nitrate antagonistically regulate expression of genes that are activated by nitrate and NIN, respectively. We propose that this antagonistic relationship prevents inappropriate activation of genes in response to nitrate and rhizobial infection.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Plant & cell physiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Regulation","uri":{"id":"D005786","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptional Activation","uri":{"id":"D015533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptional Activation","uri":{"id":"D015533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Regulatory Networks","uri":{"id":"D053263","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Regulation","uri":{"id":"D005786","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bacteria","uri":{"id":"D001419","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fabaceae","uri":{"id":"D007887","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nitrates","uri":{"id":"D009566","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabidopsis","uri":{"id":"D017360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lotus","uri":{"id":"D029885","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416287","title":"NODULE INCEPTION antagonistically regulates gene expression with nitrate in Lotus japonicus.","year":"2014"}

Sps1, a serine/threonine kinase, is required for sporulation, but relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms through which it regulates this process. Here we show that SPS1 encodes a bona-fide member of the GCKIII subfamily of STE20 kinases, both through phylogenetic analysis of the kinase domain and examination of its C-terminal regulatory domain. Within the regulatory domain, we find Sps1 contains an invariant ExxxPG region conserved from plant to human GCKIIIs that we call the EPG motif; we show this EPG motif is important for SPS1 function. We also find that Sps1 is phosphorylated near its N-terminus on Threonine 12, and that this phosphorylation is required for the efficient production of spores. In Sps1, Threonine 12 lies within a 14-3-3 consensus binding sequence, and we show that the S. cerevisiae 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2 bind Sps1 in a Threonine 12-dependent fashion. This interaction is significant, as BMH1 and BMH2 are required during sporulation and genetically interact with SPS1 in sporulating cells. Finally, we observe that Sps1, Bmh1 and Bmh2 are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm during sporulation. We identify a nuclear localization sequence in Sps1 at amino acids 411-415, and show that this sequence is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Taken together, these data identify regions within Sps1 critical for its function and indicate that SPS1 and 14-3-3s act together to promote proper sporulation in S. cerevisiae.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","uri":{"id":"D017346","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","uri":{"id":"D029701","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae","uri":{"id":"D012441","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","uri":{"id":"D017346","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomycetales","uri":{"id":"D004718","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"14-3-3 Proteins","uri":{"id":"D048948","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytoplasm","uri":{"id":"D003593","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphorylation","uri":{"id":"D010766","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphotransferases","uri":{"id":"D010770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomyces","uri":{"id":"D012440","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Threonine","uri":{"id":"D013912","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Isoforms","uri":{"id":"D020033","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spores","uri":{"id":"D013170","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Yeasts","uri":{"id":"D015003","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25409301","title":"The GCKIII Kinase Sps1 and the 14-3-3 Isoforms, Bmh1 and Bmh2, Cooperate to Ensure Proper Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","year":"2014"}

A native to Europe, tall fescue was likely introduced into the US around the late 1800's. Much of the success of tall fescue can be attributed to Epichloë coenophiala (formerly Neotyphodium coenophialum) a seed borne symbiont that aids in host persistence. Epichloë species are capable of producing a range of alkaloids (ergot alkaloids, indole-diterpenes, lolines, and peramine) that provide protection to the plant host from herbivory. Unfortunately, most tall fescue within the US, commonly referred to as \"Kentucky-31\" (KY31), harbors the endophyte E. coenophiala that causes toxicity to grazing livestock due to the production of ergot alkaloids. Molecular analyses of tall fescue endophytes have identified four independent associations, representing tall fescue with E. coenophiala, Epichloë sp. FaTG-2, Epichloë sp. FaTG-3, or Epichloë sp. FaTG-4. Each of these Epichloë species can be further distinguished based on genetic variation that equates to differences in the alkaloid gene loci. Tall fescue samples were evaluated using markers to simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and alkaloid biosynthesis genes to determine endophyte strain variation present within continental US. Samples represented seed and tillers from the Suiter farm (Menifee County, KY), which is considered the originating site of KY31, as well as plant samples collected from 14 states, breeder's seed and plant introduction lines (National Plant Germplasm System, NPGS).

However, deep coverage variations in short-read data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present new computational challenges in data interpretation, including mapping and de novo assembly. New lab techniques such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of single cells and sequence independent single primer amplification (SISPA) allow for sequencing of organisms that cannot be cultured, but generate highly variable coverage due to amplification biases.ResultsHere we introduce NeatFreq, a software tool that reduces a data set to more uniform coverage by clustering and selecting from reads binned by their median kmer frequency (RMKF) and uniqueness. Previous algorithms normalize read coverage based on RMKF, but do not include methods for the preferred selection of (1) extremely low coverage regions produced by extremely variable sequencing of random-primed products and (2) 2-sided paired-end sequences. The algorithm increases the incorporation of the most unique, lowest coverage, segments of a genome using an error-corrected data set. NeatFreq was applied to bacterial, viral plaque, and single-cell sequencing data. The algorithm showed an increase in the rate at which the most unique reads in a genome were included in the assembled consensus while also reducing the count of duplicative and erroneous contigs (strings of high confidence overlaps) in the deliverable consensus. The results obtained from conventional Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) were compared to simulated multi-de Bruijn graph assembly alternatives trained for variable coverage input using sequence before and after normalization of coverage. Coverage reduction was shown to increase processing speed and reduce memory requirements when using conventional bacterial assembly algorithms.ConclusionsThe normalization of deep coverage spikes, which would otherwise inhibit consensus resolution, enables High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) assembly projects to consistently run to completion with existing assembly software.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: -Studies of ≤15 atrial fibrillation (AF) patients have identified atrial-specific mutations within connexin genes, suggesting that somatic mutations may account for sporadic cases of the arrhythmia. We sought to identify atrial somatic mutations among patients with and without AF using targeted deep next-generation sequencing of 560 genes, including genetic culprits implicated in AF, the Mendelian cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, and all ion channels within the genome. METHODS AND RESULTS: -Targeted gene capture and next generation sequencing were performed on DNA from lymphocytes and left atrial appendages of 34 patients (25 with AF). Twenty patients had undergone cardiac surgery exclusively for pulmonary vein isolation, and 17 had no structural heart disease. Sequence alignment and variant calling were performed for each atrial-lymphocyte pair using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, the Genome Analysis Toolkit, and MuTect packages. Next generation sequencing yielded a median 265-fold coverage depth (IQR 164-369). Comparison of the 3 million base pairs from each atrial-lymphocyte pair revealed a single potential somatic missense mutation in 3 AF patients and 2 in a single control (12 vs. 11%; p=0.943). All potential discordant variants had low allelic fractions (range: 2.3-7.3%) and none were detected with conventional sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: -Using high-depth next generation sequencing and state-of-the art somatic mutation calling approaches, no pathogenic atrial somatic mutations could be confirmed among 25 AF patients in a comprehensive cardiac arrhythmia genetic panel. These findings indicate that atrial specific mutations are rare and that somatic mosaicism is unlikely to exert a prominent role in AF pathogenesis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Circulation.

The amoeba Paulinella chromatophora contains an organelle (chromatophore) that is derived from the recent endosymbiotic acquisition of a cyanobacterium, and therefore represents a model of the early steps in the acquisition of plastids. In contrast with plastid RPRs the chromatophore RPR retains functionality similar to the cyanobacterial enzyme. The chromatophore RPR sequence deviates from consensus at some positions but those changes allow optimal activity compared with mutated chromatophore RPR with the consensus sequence. We have analyzed additional RPR sequences identifiable in plastids and have found that it is present in all red algae and in several prasinophyte green algae.

Digestion of genomic DNA from M. thomasi with AluI restriction enzyme revealed a 2.2-kb repetitive DNA sequence with a high AT content (69%). This sequence consists of a tandemly repeated nonanucleotide of the consensus sequence CACAATGTA, which constitutes approximately 93-95% of the total unit length. The location of the Mth-Alu2.2 sequence in the karyotype was determined by FISH, demonstrating strong hybridization signals in the pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes and in the heterochromatin blocks of several X chromosome variants. In addition, the distribution of the 4 pericentromeric repeat sequences Msat-160, Mth-Alu900, Mth-Alu2.2, and interstitial telomeric repeats was analyzed by in situ hybridization in M. thomasi, in order to shed light on the complex composition of the chromosomal pericentromeric regions in this species. The order and organization of these sequences in the pericentromeric regions are conserved, with slight variations in both the degree of overlapping and the amount of each repeated DNA in the chromosomes. Specifically, Mth-Alu2.2 is localized in the terminal regions of the chromosomes, with Msat-160 occupying the immediately inner region, partially intermixed with Mth-Alu2.2. The sequence Mth-Alu900 is found in internal positions below Msat-160, and the interstitial telomeric repeats are located close to the long-arm euchromatin of the chromosomes. © 2014 S.

The hydrolysis of PCL was performed either before or after scaffold fabrication in the preparations of pre-HPCL or post-HPCL scaffolds, respectively. The PCL, pre-HPCL and post-HPCL scaffolds were subsequently plasma-treated to yield plasma-treated PCL, plasma-treated pre-HPCL, and plasma-treated post-HPCL scaffolds, respectively. All scaffolds were comparatively characterized, in terms of surface morphology, hydrophilicity and atomic composition using SEM, contact angle measurement and XPS, respectively. The interactions of chondrocytes with individual scaffolds were assessed, in terms of cartilage-gene expression and cartilaginous matrix production using RT-PCR analysis and GAGs assay, respectively. The cell infiltration and cartilaginous matrix distribution were investigated by histological and immunofluorescence analysis. The results revealed that the plasma treatment exhibited a more prominent effect on the enhancement of surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the scaffolds than the alkaline hydrolysis. The scaffolds subjected to both surface treatments stimulated the cells to secret more GAGs and type II collagen. The sequence of hydrolysis of PCL also evidently played a crucial role in the hydrophilicity of the materials and the cartilage-gene expression and cartilaginous matrix production of the cultured chondrocytes. The hydrolysis of PCL prior to the fabrication, followed by the oxygen plasma treatment of the resulting fabricated scaffold, yielded plasma-treated pre-HPCL scaffold with homogeneous hydrophilic characteristics all over the material.

The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation on peripheral nerve function in the population-based Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. METHODS: We investigated the role of common mitochondrial DNA variation (n = 1,580) and complete mitochondrial DNA sequences (n = 138) on peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity and amplitude, average vibration detection threshold, and monofilament sensitivity. RESULTS: Nominal associations among common mitochondrial DNA variants and haplogroups were identified but were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Sequence-based approaches were used to identify aggregate variant associations across the 16S rRNA (weighted-sum, p = 2E-05 and variable threshold, p = 9E-06) for nerve conduction velocity. Several of these rare 16S variants occurred at or near sites with earlier disease associations and are also in close proximity to the peptidyl transferase center, which is the catalytic center of the 16S rRNA CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sequence variation related to mitochondrial protein synthesis/assembly is associated with peripheral nerve function and may provide insight into targets for intervention or new clinical strategies to preserve nerve function in late life.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The journals of gerontology.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Cardiovascular disease has become the most serious health threat and represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in China, as in industrialized nations. Since the past decades, China's economic boom has tremendously improved people's living standard, but also changed people's life style boosting the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, so called \"disease of modern civilization\". This new trend has attracted the main force of research. Many of the studies conducted by Chinese investigators are orientated to understanding the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. At the molecular level, the long-standing consensus is that cardiovascular disease is associated with sequence mutation (genetic anomaly) and expression deregulation (epigenetic disorder) of protein-coding genes. However, new research data have established the non-protein-coding genes microRNAs (miRNAs) as a central regulator of pathogenesis of cardiac disease and potential new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease. These small non-coding RNAs has also garnered close attention and tremendous efforts from Chinese researchers. Over the years, a large body of studies on miRNAs in cardiovascular disease has been conducted by Chinese investigators, yielding fruitful research results and better understanding of miRNAs as a new layer of molecular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of cardiac disease. In this review, we will give a brief summary of the current status of research in the field of miRNAs and cardiovascular disease in China, highlighting the advances in elucidating the role of miRNAs in various cardiac conditions including cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and in exploring the potential of miRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers and

The 10-membered hydrogen-bonded ring involving the main-chain C=O in a β-turn can be formed using a side-chain carbonyl group leading to Asx-turn. We show that the N-H component of hydrogen bond can be replaced by a C(γ) -H group in the side chain, culminating in a non-conventional C-H⋯O interaction. Because of its shape this β-turn mimic is designated as ω-turn, which is found to occur ˜3 times per 100 residues. 3 residues (i to i+2) constitute the turn with the C-H⋯O interaction occurring between the terminal residues, constraining the torsion angles ϕi +1, ψi+1 , ϕi+2 and χ'1(i+2) (using the interacting C(γ) atom). Based on these angles there are two types of ω-turns, each of which can be further divided into two groups. C(β) -branched side-chains, and Met and Gln have high propensities to occur at i+2; for the last two residues the carbonyl oxygen may participate in an additional interaction involving the S and amino group, respectively. With Cys occupying the i+1 position, such turns are found in the metal-binding sites. N-linked glycosylation occurs at the consensus pattern Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr; with Thr at i+2, the sequence can adopt the secondary structure of a ω-turn, which may be the recognition site for protein modification. Location between two β-strands is the most common occurrence in protein tertiary structure, and being generally exposed ω-turn may constitute the antigenic determinant site.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, are one of the prominent DNA sequences shaping the repeated fraction of eukaryotic genomes. In spite of their profuse use as molecular markers for a variety of genetic and evolutionary studies, their genomic location, distribution, and function are not yet well understood. Here we report the first thorough joint analysis of microsatellite motifs at both genomic and chromosomal levels in animal species, by a combination of 454 sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques performed on two grasshopper species. The in silico analysis of the 454 reads suggested that microsatellite expansion is not driving size increase of these genomes, as SSR abundance was higher in the species showing the smallest genome. However, the two species showed the same uneven and nonrandom location of SSRs, with clear predominance of dinucleotide motifs and association with several types of repetitive elements, mostly histone gene spacers, ribosomal DNA intergenic spacers (IGS), and transposable elements (TEs). The FISH analysis showed a dispersed chromosome distribution of microsatellite motifs in euchromatic regions, in coincidence with chromosome location patterns previously observed for many mobile elements in these species. However, some SSR motifs were clustered, especially those located in the histone gene cluster.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Chromosoma","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA, Intergenic","uri":{"id":"D021901","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multigene Family","uri":{"id":"D005810","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microsatellite Repeats","uri":{"id":"D018895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA, Intergenic","uri":{"id":"D021901","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Transposable Elements","uri":{"id":"D004251","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA, Ribosomal","uri":{"id":"D004275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"In Situ Hybridization","uri":{"id":"D017403","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence","uri":{"id":"D017404","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, DNA","uri":{"id":"D017422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Simulation","uri":{"id":"D003198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drive","uri":{"id":"D004328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fluorescence","uri":{"id":"D005453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Grasshoppers","uri":{"id":"D006110","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histones","uri":{"id":"D006657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reading","uri":{"id":"D011932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ribosomes","uri":{"id":"D012270","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cluster Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microsatellite Repeats","uri":{"id":"D018895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25387401","title":"Next generation sequencing and FISH reveal uneven and nonrandom microsatellite distribution in two grasshopper genomes.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of phylogenetic information in community ecology and conservation has grown in recent years. Two key issues for community phylogenetics studies, however, are (i) low terminal phylogenetic resolution and (ii) arbitrarily defined species pools. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used three DNA barcodes (plastid DNA regions rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) to infer a phylogeny for 527 native and naturalized trees of Puerto Rico, representing the vast majority of the entire tree flora of the island (89%). We used a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with and without a constraint tree that enforced monophyly of recognized plant orders. Based on 50% consensus trees, the ML analyses improved phylogenetic resolution relative to a comparable phylogeny generated with Phylomatic (proportion of internal nodes resolved: constrained ML = 74%, unconstrained ML = 68%, Phylomatic = 52%). We quantified the phylogenetic composition of 15 protected forests in Puerto Rico using the constrained ML and Phylomatic phylogenies. We found some evidence that tree communities in areas of high water stress were relatively phylogenetically clustered. Reducing the scale at which the species pool was defined (from island to soil types) changed some of our results depending on which phylogeny (ML vs. Phylomatic) was used. Overall, the increased terminal resolution provided by the ML phylogeny revealed additional patterns that were not observed with a less-resolved phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With the DNA barcode phylogeny presented here (based on an island-wide species pool), we show that a more fully resolved phylogeny increases power to detect nonrandom patterns of community composition in several Puerto Rican tree communities. Especially if combined with additional information on species functional traits and geographic distributions, this phylogeny will (i) facilitate stronger inferences about the role of historical processes in governing the assembly and composition of Puerto Rican forests, (ii) provide insight into Caribbean biogeography, and (iii) aid in incorporating evolutionary history into conservation planning.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, DNA","uri":{"id":"D017422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Puerto Rico","uri":{"id":"D011647","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dehydration","uri":{"id":"D003681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hispanic Americans","uri":{"id":"D006630","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ecology","uri":{"id":"D004463","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Trees","uri":{"id":"D014197","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cluster Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044382","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phylogeny","uri":{"id":"D010802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caribbean Region","uri":{"id":"D017691","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plastids","uri":{"id":"D018087","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25386879","title":"A well-resolved phylogeny of the trees of puerto rico based on DNA barcode sequence data.","year":"2014"}

The isolated yeast showed maximum growth at 30 °C, pH 7.0, and the strain was identified as Candida tropicalis through 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analysis. Yeast cells grew well in medium containing different concentrations of heavy metal ions [CdCl2, Pb(NO3)2, NaAsO2, CuSO4 and K2Cr2O7]. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against different metal ions was ranged from 5 to 19 mM, and the metal resistance value against each metal observed by yeast cells was 5 mM (Cr), 10 mM (Cd), 15 mM (As), 14 mM (Cu) and 19 mM (Pb) and increased in the following order: Pb > Cu > As ≥ Cd > Cr. The total cellular glutathione, GSH/GSSG redox couple and metallothioneins like protein (MT) were assayed by growing cultures for 24 h and exposed to 100 mg/L of each heavy metal ion. Remarkable increase in γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine (GSH) level was determined in arsenic and cadmium treatment followed by chromium, lead and copper. Stressed cells had much more oxidized GSH than unstressed cells. GSH/GSSG ratio was significantly increased in cadmium and copper treatment in contrast to chromium, arsenic and lead. Statistical analysis revealed significantly higher cysteine level in all metal-treated samples as compared to control. Antioxidant glutathione transferase activity was not detected in metal-treated and untreated yeast samples. One-dimensional electrophoresis of proteins revealed marked differences in banding pattern of heavy metal-exposed yeast samples. A prominent 20 kDa band was observed in all treated samples suggesting that some differential proteins could be over-expressed during heavy metal treatment and might be involved in cell resistance

The expected degree of the network is the average number of neighbors, where average may be computed with respect to the either the uniform or Boltzmann probability. Here, we describe the first algorithm, RNAexpNumNbors, that can compute the expected number of neighbors, or expected network degree, of an input sequence. For RNA sequences from the Rfam database, the expected degree is significantly less than the constrained minimum free energy structure, defined to have minimum free energy (MFE) over all structures consistent with the Rfam consensus structure. The expected degree of structural RNAs, such as purine riboswitches, paradoxically appears to be smaller than that of random RNA, yet the difference between the degree of the MFE structure and the expected degree is larger than that of random RNA.

Here, we use quantitative mass-spectrometry to define acetylations targeted by the sirtuin family, previously implicated in the regulation of non-histone protein acetylation. To identify HATs that promote acetylation of these sites, we also performed this analysis in gcn5 (SAGA) and esa1 (NuA4) mutants. We observed strong sequence specificity for the sirtuins and for each of these HATs. While the Gcn5 and Esa1 consensus sequences are entirely distinct, the sirtuin consensus overlaps almost entirely with that of Gcn5, suggesting a strong coordination between these two regulatory enzymes. Furthermore, by examining global acetylation in an ada2 mutant, which dissociates Gcn5 from the SAGA complex, we found that a subset of Gcn5 targets did not depend on an intact SAGA complex for targeting. Our work provides a framework for understanding how HAT and HDAC enzymes collaborate to regulate critical cellular processes related to growth and division.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cooperative Behavior","uri":{"id":"D003299","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histones","uri":{"id":"D006657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetylation","uri":{"id":"D000107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dissociative Disorders","uri":{"id":"D004213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sirtuins","uri":{"id":"D037761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25381059","title":"Acetylome profiling reveals overlap in the regulation of diverse processes by sirtuins, Gcn5 and Esa1.","year":"2014"}

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a method for studying BBB disruption in vivo. We review pathologies studied, scanning protocols and data analysis procedures to determine the range of available methods and their suitability to different pathologies. We systematically review the existing literature up to February 2014, seeking studies that assessed BBB integrity using T1-weighted DCE-MRI techniques in animals and humans in normal or abnormal brain tissues. The literature search provided 70 studies that were eligible for inclusion, involving 417 animals and 1564 human subjects in total. The pathologies most studied are intracranial neoplasms and acute ischemic strokes. There are large variations in the type of DCE-MRI sequence, the imaging protocols and the contrast agents used. Moreover, studies use a variety of different methods for data analysis, mainly based on model-free measurements and on the Patlak and Tofts models. Consequently, estimated K (Trans) values varied widely. In conclusion, DCE-MRI is shown to provide valuable information in a large variety of applications, ranging from common applications, such as grading of primary brain tumors, to more recent applications, such as assessment of subtle BBB dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Further research is required in order to establish consensus-based recommendations for data acquisition and analysis and, hence, improve inter-study comparability and promote wider use of DCE-MRI.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"NeuroImage.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Cellular immunity is pivotal in HIV-1 pathogenesis, but hampered by viral sequence diversity. An approach to minimize this diversity is to focus immunity on conserved proteome sequences; therefore we selected four relatively conserved regions (Gag amino acids 148-214 and 250-335, Env 521-606, and Nef 106-148), each created in three mosaics to provide better coverage of M-group HIV-1 sequences. A conserved region vaccine (CRV) delivering genes for these four regions as equal mixtures of three mosaics (each region at a separate injection site) was compared to a whole protein vaccine (WPV) delivering equimolar amounts of genes for whole Gag, Env, and Nef as clade B consensus sequences (separate injection sites). Three rhesus macaques were vaccinated via three DNA primes and a recombinant adenovirus-5 boost (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 24 respectively). Although CRV inserts were about a fifth that of WPV, the CRV generated comparable magnitude blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses against Gag, Env, and Nef. WPV responses preferentially targeted proteome areas outside the selected conserved regions in direct proportion to sequence lengths, indicating similar immunogenicities for the conserved regions versus the outside regions. The CRV yielded conserved region targeting density that was approximately five-fold that of the WPV. A similar pattern was seen in bronchoalveolar lymphocytes, but quadruple the magnitudes in blood. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the selected conserved regions are highly immunogenic, and that anatomically isolated vaccinations with these regions focuses immunodominance compared to full-length protein vaccination. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 sequence diversity is a major barrier limiting the capability of cellular immunity to contain infection and the ability of vaccines to match circulating viral sequences. To date, vaccines tested in humans have delivered whole proteins or genes for whole proteins, and it is unclear whether including only conserved sequences would yield sufficient cellular immunogenicity. We tested a vaccine delivering genes for four small conserved HIV-1 regions compared to a control vaccine with genes for whole Gag, Env, and Nef. Although the conserved regions ranged from 43 to 86 amino acids and comprised less than one fifth of whole Gag/Env/Nef, the vaccines elicited equivalent total magnitudes of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. These data demonstrate immunogenicity of these small conserved regions, and the potential for a vaccine to steer immunodominance towards conserved epitopes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of virology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Conserved Sequence","uri":{"id":"D017124","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity, Cellular","uri":{"id":"D007111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Macaca mulatta","uri":{"id":"D008253","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Conserved Sequence","uri":{"id":"D017124","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epitopes","uri":{"id":"D000939","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D008214","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Macaca","uri":{"id":"D008251","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccination","uri":{"id":"D014611","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccines","uri":{"id":"D014612","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Viruses","uri":{"id":"D014780","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV-1","uri":{"id":"D015497","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteome","uri":{"id":"D020543","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteomics","uri":{"id":"D040901","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25378501","title":"Short Conserved Sequences of HIV-1 Are Highly Immunogenic and Shift Immunodominance.","year":"2014"}

We explored the potential and caveats of this strategy in four genetically distant Lilium cultivars to estimate their genetic divergence from transcriptome sequences using three approaches: POFAD (Phylogeny of Organisms from Allelic Data, uses allelic information of sequence data), RAxML (Randomized Accelerated Maximum Likelihood, tree building based on concatenated consensus sequences) and Consensus Network (constructing a network summarizing among gene tree conflicts). Twenty six gene contigs were chosen based on the presence of orthologous sequences in all cultivars, seven of which also had an orthologous sequence in Tulipa, used as out-group. The three approaches generated the same topology. Although the resolution offered by these approaches is high, in this case there was no extra benefit in using allelic information. We conclude that these 26 genes can be widely applied to construct a species tree for the genus Lilium.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acceleration","uri":{"id":"D000054","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phylogeny","uri":{"id":"D010802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Liliaceae","uri":{"id":"D019668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lilium","uri":{"id":"D027762","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tulipa","uri":{"id":"D031447","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25368628","title":"Using multi-locus allelic sequence data to estimate genetic divergence among four Lilium (Liliaceae) cultivars.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The fauna of Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, the largest freshwater body on Earth, is characterized by high degrees of biodiversity and endemism. Amphipods, a prominent taxon within the indigenous fauna, occur in an exceptionally high number of endemic species. Considering the specific water chemistry of Lake Baikal with extremely low levels of potentially toxic natural organic compounds, it seems conceivable that certain adaptions to adverse environmental factors are missing in endemic species, such as cellular defense mechanisms mitigating toxic effects of chemicals. The degree to which the endemic fauna is affected by the recently occurring anthropogenic water pollution of Lake Baikal may depend on the existence of such cellular defense mechanisms in those species. We here show that endemic amphipods express transcripts for Abcb1, a major component of the cellular multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) defense against toxic chemicals. Based on a partial abcb1 cDNA sequence from Gammarus lacustris, an amphipod species common across Northern Eurasia but only rarely found in Lake Baikal, respective homologous sequences were cloned from five amphipods endemic to Lake Baikal, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus, E. vittatus, E. cyaneus, E. marituji, and Gmelinoides fasciatus, confirming that abcb1 is transcribed in those species. The effects of thermal (25 °C) and chemical stress (1-2 mg L(-1) phenanthrene) in short-term exposures (up to 24 h) on transcript levels of abcb1 and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), used as a proxy for cellular stress in the experiments, were exemplarily examined in E. verrucosus, E. cyaneus, and Gammarus lacustris. Whereas increases of abcb1 transcripts upon treatments occurred only in the Baikalian species E. verrucosus and E. cyaneus but not in Gammarus lacustris, changes of hsp70 transcript levels were seen in all three species. At least for species endemic to Lake Baikal, the data thus indicate that regulation of the identified amphipod abcb1 is triggered within the general cellular stress response. This is the first report presenting molecular data on a MXR transporter in amphipods, an ecotoxicologically important but with regard to gene sequence data comparatively little explored taxon.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Defense Mechanisms","uri":{"id":"D003674","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heat-Shock Proteins","uri":{"id":"D006360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Water Pollution","uri":{"id":"D014876","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Homology","uri":{"id":"D017385","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins","uri":{"id":"D018840","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemistry","uri":{"id":"D002621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fresh Water","uri":{"id":"D005618","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA, Complementary","uri":{"id":"D018076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proxy","uri":{"id":"D019727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biodiversity","uri":{"id":"D044822","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lakes","uri":{"id":"D060106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenanthrenes","uri":{"id":"D010616","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Siberia","uri":{"id":"D012800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amphipoda","uri":{"id":"D033304","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25367643","title":"Identification of a putatively multixenobiotic resistance related Abcb1 transporter in amphipod species endemic to the highly pristine Lake Baikal.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Recent attempts at a collective understanding of how to develop an e-Health strategy have addressed the individual organisation, collection of organisations, and national levels. At the national level the World Health Organisation's National eHealth Strategy Toolkit serves as an exemplar that consolidates knowledge in this area, guides practical implementations, and identifies areas for future research. A key implication of this toolkit is the considerable number of organisational changes required to successfully apply their ideas in practice. This study looks critically at the confluence of change management and e-Health strategy using metaphors that underpin established models of change management. Several of Morgan's organisational metaphors are presented (highlighting varied beliefs and assumptions regarding how change is enacted, who is responsible for the change, and guiding principles for that change), and used to provide a framework. Attention is then directed to several prominent models of change management that exemplify one or more of these metaphors, and these theoretical insights are applied to evaluate the World Health Organisation's National eHealth Strategy Toolkit. The paper presents areas for consideration when using the WHO/ITU toolkit, and suggestions on how to improve its use in practice. The goal is to seek insight regarding the optimal sequence of steps needed to ensure successful implementation and integration of e-health into health systems using change management models. No single model, toolkit, or guideline will offer all the needed answers, but clarity around the underlying metaphors informing the change management models being used provides valuable insight so potentially challenging areas can be avoided or mitigated.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Studies in health technology and informatics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Status","uri":{"id":"D006304","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"World Health","uri":{"id":"D014943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"World Health Organization","uri":{"id":"D014944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"World Health Organization","uri":{"id":"D014944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Principle-Based Ethics","uri":{"id":"D028662","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suggestion","uri":{"id":"D013404","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Telemedicine","uri":{"id":"D017216","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metaphor","uri":{"id":"D019365","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25365672","title":"Applying change management metaphors to a national e-Health strategy.","year":"2014"}

Two well-defined inverted repeat sequences (IR1 and IR2) were identified in the upstream region of ahpC. Using a crp (cAMP receptor protein: MSMEG_6189) mutant and in vitro DNA-binding assay, it was demonstrated that the IR1 sequence serves as a Crp-binding site and that Crp functions as an activator in the regulation of ahpC expression. The expression level of ahpC was shown to be proportional to intracellular cAMP levels. Intracellular levels of cAMP were increased in M. smegmatis, when it was treated with oxidative stress inducers. The IR2 sequence is very similar to the known consensus sequence of FurA-binding sites and involved in the negative regulation of ahpC expression. Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of ahpC expression under oxidative stress conditions probably results from a combinatory effect of both inactivation of FurA by oxidative stress and activation of Crp in response to increased levels of cAMP.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutant Proteins","uri":{"id":"D050505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Inversion","uri":{"id":"D057345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidative Stress","uri":{"id":"D018384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein","uri":{"id":"D002373","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, Cyclic AMP","uri":{"id":"D011953","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mycobacterium smegmatis","uri":{"id":"D020102","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peroxiredoxins","uri":{"id":"D054464","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inverted Repeat Sequences","uri":{"id":"D055029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alkylation","uri":{"id":"D000478","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Camping","uri":{"id":"D002165","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxides","uri":{"id":"D010087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidoreductases","uri":{"id":"D010088","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alkylating Agents","uri":{"id":"D000477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrogen Peroxide","uri":{"id":"D006861","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mycobacterium","uri":{"id":"D009161","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25365321","title":"Regulation of the ahpC Gene Encoding Alkyl Hydroperoxide Reductase in Mycobacterium smegmatis.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The analysis of sequence conservation is commonly used to predict functionally important sites in proteins. We have developed an approach that first identi-fies highly conserved sites in a set of orthologous sequences using a weighted substitution-matrix-based conservation score and then filters these conserved sites based on the pattern of conservation present in a wider alignment of se-quences from the same family and structural information to identify surface exposed sites. This allows us to detect specific functional sites in the target protein and exclude regions that are likely to be generally important for the structure or function of the wider protein family. We applied our method to two members of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. We first confirmed that our method successfully detected the known heparin binding site in antithrombin while excluding residues known to be general important in the serpin family. We next applied our sequence analysis approach to neuroserpin and used our results to guide site-directed polyalanine mutagenesis experiments. The majority of the mutant neuroserpin proteins were found to fold correctly and could still form inhibitory complexes with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Kinetic analysis of tPA inhibition, however, revealed altered inhibitory kinetics in several of the mutant proteins, with some mutants showing decreased association with tPA and others showing more rapid dissociation of the covalent complex. Altogether, these results confirm that our sequence analysis approach is a useful tool that can be used to guide mutagenesis experiments for the detection of specific functional sites in proteins. © Proteins 2014;. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proteins","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Alignment","uri":{"id":"D016415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutagenesis, Site-Directed","uri":{"id":"D016297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutant Proteins","uri":{"id":"D050505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protease Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D011480","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Transport","uri":{"id":"D021381","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine Proteases","uri":{"id":"D057057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","uri":{"id":"D010959","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plasminogen Activators","uri":{"id":"D010960","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine Proteinase Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D015842","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Conserved Sequence","uri":{"id":"D017124","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutant Proteins","uri":{"id":"D050505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heparin","uri":{"id":"D006493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kinetics","uri":{"id":"D007700","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptide Hydrolases","uri":{"id":"D010447","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plasminogen","uri":{"id":"D010958","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antithrombins","uri":{"id":"D000991","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dissociative Disorders","uri":{"id":"D004213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serpins","uri":{"id":"D015843","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutagenesis","uri":{"id":"D016296","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25363759","title":"An analysis approach to identify specific functional sites in orthologous proteins using sequence and structural information: Application to neuroserpin reveals regions that differentially regulate inhibitory activity.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Advances in human genomics have allowed unprecedented productivity in terms of algorithms, software, and literature available for translating raw next-generation sequence data into high-quality information. The challenges of variant identification in organisms with lower quality reference genomes are less well documented. We explored the consequences of commonly recommended preparatory steps and the effects of single and multi sample variant identification methods using four publicly available software applications (Platypus, HaplotypeCaller, Samtools and UnifiedGenotyper) on whole genome sequence data of 65 key ancestors of Swiss dairy cattle populations. Accuracy of calling next-generation sequence variants was assessed by comparison to the same loci from medium and high-density single nucleotide variant (SNV) arrays. RESULTS: The total number of SNVs identified varied by software and method, with single (multi) sample results ranging from 17.7 to 22.0 (16.9 to 22.0) million variants. Computing time varied considerably between software. Preparatory realignment of insertions and deletions and subsequent base quality score recalibration had only minor effects on the number and quality of SNVs identified by different software, but increased computing time considerably. Average concordance for single (multi) sample results with high-density chip data was 58.3% (87.0%) and average genotype concordance in correctly identified SNVs was 99.2% (99.2%) across software. The average quality of SNVs identified, measured as the ratio of transitions to transversions, was higher using single sample methods than multi sample methods. A consensus approach using results of different software generally provided the highest variant quality in terms of transition/transversion ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings serve as a reference for variant identification pipeline development in non-human organisms and help assess the implication of preparatory steps in next-generation sequencing pipelines for organisms with incomplete reference genomes (pipeline code is included). Benchmarking this information should prove particularly useful in processing next-generation sequencing data for use in genome-wide association studies and genomic selection.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC genomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Human","uri":{"id":"D015894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome-Wide Association Study","uri":{"id":"D055106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cattle","uri":{"id":"D002417","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Software","uri":{"id":"D012984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Minors","uri":{"id":"D033242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dairying","uri":{"id":"D003612","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Platypus","uri":{"id":"D010987","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25361890","title":"Evaluation of variant identification methods for whole genome sequencing data in dairy cattle.","year":"2014"}

We used single genome amplification and phylogenetic analyses to characterize transmitted/founder SIVs both in the inoculum and in immunized-infected rhesus monkeys. Single genome amplification of the SIVsmE660 inoculum revealed a maximum diversity of 1.4%. We also noted that the consensus sequence of the challenge stock differed from the vaccine construct in 10 amino acids including 3 changes in the V4 loop. Viral env was prepared from rhesus plasma in 3 groups of 6 immunized with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors and boosted with Semliki forest virus (SFV) replicons expressing (a) SIVsmE660 gag-env (b) SIVsmE660 gag-env plus rhesus GM-CSF and (c) control influenza hemagglutinin protein. Macaques were immunized twice with VSV-vectors and once with SFV vector and challenged intrarectally with 4000 TCID50. Single genome amplification characterized the infections of 2 unprotected animals in the gag-env immunized group, both of which had reduced acute plasma viral loads that ended as transient infections indicating partial immune control. Four of 6 rhesus were infected in the gag-env + GM-CSF group which demonstrated that GM-CSF abrogated protection. All 6 animals from the control group were infected having high plasma viral loads. We obtained 246 full-length envelope sequences from SIVsmE660 infected macaques at the peak of infection and determined the number of transmitted/founder variants per animal. Our analysis found that 2 of 2 gag-env vaccinated but infected macaques exhibited single but distinct virus envelope lineages whereas rhesus vaccinated with gag-env-GM-CSF or HA control exhibited both single and multiple env lineages. Because there were only 2 infected animals in the gag-env vaccinated rhesus compared to 10 infected rhesus in the other 2 groups, the significance of finding single env variants in the gag-env vaccinated group could not be established.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Genetics is believed to have an important role in intellectual disability (ID). Recent studies have emphasized the involvement of de novo mutations (DNMs) in ID but the extent to which they contribute to its pathogenesis and the identity of the corresponding genes remain largely unknown. Here, we report a screen for DNMs in subjects with moderate or severe ID. We sequenced the exomes of 41 probands and their parents, and confirmed 81 DNMs affecting the coding sequence or consensus splice sites (1.98 DNMs/proband). We observed a significant excess of de novo single nucleotide substitutions and loss-of-function mutations in these cases compared to control subjects, suggesting that at least a subset of these variations are pathogenic. A total of 12 likely pathogenic DNMs were identified in genes previously associated with ID (ARID1B, CHD2, FOXG1, GABRB3, GATAD2B, GRIN2B, MBD5, MED13L, SETBP1, TBR1, TCF4, WDR45), resulting in a diagnostic yield of ∼29%. We also identified 12 possibly pathogenic DNMs in genes (HNRNPU, WAC, RYR2, SET, EGR1, MYH10, EIF2C1, COL4A3BP, CHMP2A, PPP1CB, VPS4A, PPP2R2B) that have not previously been causally linked to ID. Interestingly, no case was explained by inherited mutations. Protein network analysis indicated that the products of many of these known and candidate genes interact with each other or with products of other ID-associated genes further supporting their involvement in ID. We conclude that DNMs represent a major cause of moderate or severe ID.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PLoS genetics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intellectual Disability","uri":{"id":"D008607","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parents","uri":{"id":"D010290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wills","uri":{"id":"D014918","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Causality","uri":{"id":"D015984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exome","uri":{"id":"D059472","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25356899","title":"De novo mutations in moderate or severe intellectual disability.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Every year pathogenic organisms cause billions of dollars' worth damage to crops and livestock. In agriculture, study of plant-microbe interactions is demanding a special attention to develop management strategies for the destructive pathogen induced diseases that cause huge crop losses every year worldwide. Pseudomonas syringae is a major bacterial leaf pathogen that causes diseases in a wide range of plant species. Among its various strains, pathovar tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000) is asserted to infect the plant host Arabidopsis thaliana and thus, has been accepted as a model system for experimental characterization of the molecular dynamics of plant-pathogen interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in initiating pathogenesis and maintaining infection. Understanding the PPI network between a host and pathogen is a critical step for studying the molecular basis of pathogenesis. The experimental study of PPIs at a large scale is very scarce and also the high throughput experimental results show high false positive rate. Hence, there is a need for developing efficient computational models to predict the interaction between host and pathogen in a genome scale, and find novel candidate effectors and/or their targets. RESULTS: In this study, we used two computational approaches, the interolog and the domain-based to predict the interactions between Arabidopsis and PstDC3000 in genome scale. The interolog method relies on protein sequence similarity to conduct the PPI prediction. A Pseudomonas protein and an Arabidopsis protein are predicted to interact with each other if an experimentally verified interaction exists between their respective homologous proteins in another organism. The domain-based method uses domain interaction information, which is derived from known protein 3D structures, to infer the potential PPIs. If a Pseudomonas and an Arabidopsis protein contain an interacting domain pair, one can expect the two proteins to interact with each other. The interolog-based method predicts ~0.79M PPIs involving around 7700 Arabidopsis and 1068 Pseudomonas proteins in the full genome. The domain-based method predicts 85650 PPIs comprising 11432 Arabidopsis and 887 Pseudomonas proteins. Further, around 11000 PPIs have been identified as interacting from both the methods as a consensus. CONCLUSION: The present work predicts the protein-protein interaction network between Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in a genome wide scale with a high confidence. Although the predicted PPIs may contain some false positives, the computational methods provide reasonable amount of interactions which can be further validated by high throughput experiments. This can be a useful resource to the plant community to characterize the host-pathogen interaction in Arabidopsis and Pseudomonas system. Further, these prediction models can be applied to the agriculturally relevant crops.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC bioinformatics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Crops, Agricultural","uri":{"id":"D018556","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Staphylococcal Protein A","uri":{"id":"D013205","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabidopsis","uri":{"id":"D017360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Dynamics Simulation","uri":{"id":"D056004","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Simulation","uri":{"id":"D003198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabidopsis Proteins","uri":{"id":"D029681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pseudomonas syringae","uri":{"id":"D044224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Host-Pathogen Interactions","uri":{"id":"D054884","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pseudomonas","uri":{"id":"D011549","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Specialization","uri":{"id":"D013038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabidopsis","uri":{"id":"D017360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Livestock","uri":{"id":"D058751","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Agriculture","uri":{"id":"D000383","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Assertiveness","uri":{"id":"D001242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Syringa","uri":{"id":"D031662","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25350354","title":"Predicting genome-scale Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas syringae interactome using domain and interolog-based approaches.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters, including ABCC3, is a large family of efflux pumps that plays a pivotal role in the elimination of xenobiotics from the body. ABCC3 has been reported to be induced during hepatic stress conditions and through the progression of some forms of cancer. Several lines of evidence have implicated the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in this induction. However, although rodent models have been investigated, a functional antioxidant response element (ARE) in the human ABCC3 gene has not been identified. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the ARE(s) responsible for mediating the Nrf2-dependent induction of the human ABCC3 gene. A high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis performed in A549 cells revealed a specific interaction between Nrf2 and the eighth intron of the human ABCC3 gene rather than the more prototypical flanking region of the gene. Subsequent in silico analysis of the intron identified two putative ARE elements that contained the core consensus ARE sequence commonly found in several Nrf2-responsive genes. Functional characterization of these two AREs using luciferase-reporter constructs with ARE mutant constructs revealed that one of these putative AREs is functionally active. Finally, DNA pull-down assays confirmed specific binding of these intronic AREs by Nrf2 in vitro. Our findings identify a functional Nrf2 response element within the eighth intron of the ABCC3 gene, which may provide mechanistic insight into the induction of ABCC3 during antioxidant response stimuli.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Activator Appliances","uri":{"id":"D000202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Response Elements","uri":{"id":"D020218","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antioxidant Response Elements","uri":{"id":"D061745","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antioxidants","uri":{"id":"D000975","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromatin","uri":{"id":"D002843","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Simulation","uri":{"id":"D003198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis","uri":{"id":"D006505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Introns","uri":{"id":"D007438","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rodentia","uri":{"id":"D012377","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Xenobiotics","uri":{"id":"D015262","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25349122","title":"Identification of a Functional Antioxidant Response Element within the Eighth Intron of the Human ABCC3 Gene.","year":"2015"}

In this study, we analyzed TMP-SMX resistance genes and their relatedness with integrons and insertion sequence common regions (ISCRs) in uropathogenic gram negative bacilli. Consecutive non-duplicate TMP-SMX non-susceptible clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa were collected from urine. Minimal inhibitory concentration was determined by Etest. TMP-SMX resistance genes (sul and dfr), integrons and ISCRs were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. A total of 45 E. coli (37.8%), 15 K. pneumoniae (18.5%), 12 Acinetobacter spp. (70.6%), and 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.0%) isolates were found to be resistant to TMX- SMX. Their MICs were all over 640. In E. coli and K. pneumonia, sul1 and dfr genes were highly prevalent in relation with integron1. Sul3 gene was detected in E. coli. In P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., only sul1 was prevalent in relation with class 1 integron, however, dfr was not detected and sul2 was less prevalent than in Enterobacteriaceae. ISCR1 and/or ISCR2 were detected in E. coli, K. pnuemoniae, and Acinetobacter spp. but relatedness with TMP-SMX resistance genes was not prominent. ISCR14 was detected in 6 isolates of E. coli. In conclusion, resistance mechanisms for TMX-SMX were different between Enterobacteriaceae and glucose non-fermenting gram negative bacilli.

We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Ribosomal RNAs are the most abundant and universal noncoding RNAs in living organisms. In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms. However, major differences between mammalian and yeast pre-ribosomal RNA processing have recently come to light. For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.

The Notch signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in somite formation and patterning in model vertebrates. In humans, mutations in several genes involved in the Notch pathway are associated with SDV, with both autosomal recessive (MESP2, DLL3, LFNG, HES7) and autosomal dominant (TBX6) inheritance. However, many individuals with SDV do not carry mutations in these genes. Using whole exome capture and massive parallel sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous mutations in RIPPLY2 in two brothers with multiple regional SDV, with appropriate familial segregation. One novel mutation (c.A238T:p.Arg80*) introduces a premature stop codon. In transiently transfected C2C12 mouse myoblasts, the RIPPLY2 mutant protein demonstrated impaired transcriptional repression activity compared with wildtype RIPPLY2 despite similar levels of expression. The other mutation (c.240-4T>G), with minor allele frequency <0.002, lies in the highly conserved splice site consensus sequence 5' to the terminal exon. Ripply2 has a well-established role in somitogenesis and vertebral column formation, interacting at both gene and protein levels with SDV-associated Mesp2 and Tbx6. We conclude that compound heterozygous mutations in RIPPLY2 are associated with SDV, a new gene for this condition.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Human molecular

Common use of dsrAB as a functional marker showed that dsrAB richness in many environments is dominated by novel sequence variants and collectively represents an extensive, largely uncharted sequence assemblage. Here, we established a comprehensive, manually curated dsrAB/DsrAB database and used it to categorize the known dsrAB diversity, reanalyze the evolutionary history of dsrAB and evaluate the coverage of published dsrAB-targeted primers. Based on a DsrAB consensus phylogeny, we introduce an operational classification system for environmental dsrAB sequences that integrates established taxonomic groups with operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at multiple phylogenetic levels, ranging from DsrAB enzyme families that reflect reductive or oxidative DsrAB types of bacterial or archaeal origin, superclusters, uncultured family-level lineages to species-level OTUs. Environmental dsrAB sequences constituted at least 13 stable family-level lineages without any cultivated representatives, suggesting that major taxa of sulfite/sulfate-reducing microorganisms have not yet been identified. Three of these uncultured lineages occur mainly in marine environments, while specific habitat preferences are not evident for members of the other 10 uncultured lineages. In summary, our publically available dsrAB/DsrAB database, the phylogenetic framework, the multilevel classification system and a set of recommended primers provide a necessary foundation for large-scale dsrAB ecology studies with next-generation sequencing methods.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 24 October 2014;

Human transformer 2β (Tra2β) is a serine/arginine-rich-like protein splicing factor and is now implicated to have wide-ranging roles in gene expression as an RNA-binding protein. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with an anti-Tra2β antibody and microarray analysis identified a subset of Tra2β-associated mRNAs in HCT116 human colon cancer cells, many of which encoded cell death-related proteins including Bcl-2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2). Tra2β knockdown in HCT116 cells decreased Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis. Tra2β knockdown accelerated the decay of BCL2α mRNA that encodes Bcl-2 and full-length 3' UTR, while it did not affect the stability of BCL2β mRNA having a short, alternatively spliced 3' UTR different from BCL2α 3' UTR. RIP assays with anti-Tra2β and anti-Argonaute 2 antibodies, respectively, showed that Tra2β bound to BCL2α 3' UTR, and that Tra2β knockdown facilitated association of miR-204 with BCL2α 3' UTR. The consensus sequence (GAA) for Tra2β-binding lies within the miR-204-binding site of BCL2 3' UTR. Mutation of the consensus sequence canceled the binding of Tra2β to BCL2 3' UTR without disrupting miR-204-binding to BCL2 3' UTR. Transfection of an anti-miR-204 or introduction of three-point mutations into the miR-204-binding site increased BCL2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein levels. Inversely, transfection of precursor miR-204 reduced their levels. Experiments with Tra2β-silenced or overexpressed cells revealed that Tra2β antagonized the effects of miR-204 and upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, TRA2β mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in 22 colon cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissues and positively correlated with BCL2 mRNA expression. Tra2β knockdown in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) increased their sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Taken together, our findings suggest that Tra2β regulates apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 expression through its competition with miR-204. This novel function may have a crucial role in tumor growth.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 24 October 2014;

This article critically reviews the literature pertinent to the epidemiology, pathology, molecular biology, diagnosis, management, and perspectives of patients with USC. METHODS: As one of a series of The Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) Rare Tumor Working Group in London, November 2013, we discussed about USC many times with various experts among international GCIG groups. RESULTS: Both USC and approximately 25% of high-grade endometrioid tumors represent extensive copy number alterations, few DNA methylation changes, low estrogen and progesterone levels, and frequent P53mutations. Uterine serous carcinoma shares molecular characteristics with ovarian serous and basal-like breast carcinomas. In addition to optimal surgery, platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy should be considered in the treatment of both early- and advanced-stage disease. The combination of radiation and chemotherapy appears to be associated with the highest survival rates. The role of radiation therapy in the management of this disease, with a high propensity for distant failures, remains elusive. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine serous carcinoma is a unique and biologically aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer and should be studied as a distinct entity. Futures studies should identify the optimized chemotherapy and radiation regimens, sequence of therapy and schedule, and the role of targeted biologic therapy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer

The glycosylation status of a specific site may influence the location, activity and function of a protein. The initiating enzyme of mucin-type O-glycosylation is UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc transferase (ppGalNAcT; EC 2.4.1.41). Using electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry, ppGalNAcT from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata was characterized regarding its ability to glycosylate threonine and serine residues in different peptide sequence environments. The preferences of the snail enzyme for flanking amino acids of the potential glycosylation site were very similar to vertebrate and insect members of the family. Acceptor sites with adjacent proline residues were highly preferred, while other residues caused less pronounced effects. No specific O-glycosylation consensus sequence was found. The results obtained from synthetic peptides were in good correlation with the observed glycosylation patterns of native peptides and with the order of attachment in a multi-glycosylated peptide. The snail enzyme clearly preferred threonine over serine in the in vitro assays. No significant differences of transfer speed or efficiency could be detected using a mutant of the enzyme lacking the lectin domain. This is the first characterisation of the substrate specificity of a member of the ppGalNAcT family from mollusc origin.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Glycoconjugate journal","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Activator Appliances","uri":{"id":"D000202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Processing, Post-Translational","uri":{"id":"D011499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mass Spectrometry","uri":{"id":"D013058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Substrate Specificity","uri":{"id":"D013379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomphalaria","uri":{"id":"D001700","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glycosylation","uri":{"id":"D006031","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrum Analysis","uri":{"id":"D013057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Threonine","uri":{"id":"D013912","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vertebrates","uri":{"id":"D014714","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044382","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dissociative Disorders","uri":{"id":"D004213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mollusca","uri":{"id":"D008974","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proline","uri":{"id":"D011392","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transferases","uri":{"id":"D014166","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases","uri":{"id":"D017350","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lectins","uri":{"id":"D037102","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25338825","title":"UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata - substrate specificity and preference of glycosylation sites.","year":"2014"}

In its regulatory role, IHF binds to a specific sequence to introduce a strong bend in the DNA; this provides a duplex architecture conducive to the assembly of site-specific nucleoprotein complexes. Alternatively, the protein can bind in a sequence-independent manner that weakly bends and wraps the duplex to promote nucleoid formation. IHF is also required for the development several viruses including bacteriophage lambda where it promotes site-specific assembly of a genome packaging motor required for lytic development. Multiple IHF consensus sequences have been identified within the packaging initiation site (cos) and we here interrogate IHF-cos binding interactions using complementary electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) approaches. IHF recognizes a single consensus sequence within cos (I1) to afford a strongly bent nucleoprotein complex. In contrast, IHF binds weakly but with positive cooperativity to non-specific DNA to afford an ensemble of complexes of increasing mass and condensation. Global analysis of the EMS and AUC data provides constrained thermodynamic binding constants and nearest neighbor cooperativity factors for IHF binding to I1 and to non-specific DNA substrates. At elevated IHF concentrations, the nucleoprotein complexes transition from a condensed to an extended rod-like conformation; specific binding of IHF to I1 imparts a significant energy barrier to the transition. The results provide insight into how IHF can assemble specific regulatory complexes in the background of extensive non-specific DNA condensation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biochemistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carrier

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: We demonstrated the successful optimization of a recombinant multi-subunit malaria vaccine candidate protein for production in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris by the identification and subsequent removal of two protease cleavage sites. After observing protein degradation in the culture supernatant of a fed-batch fermentation, the predominant proteolytic fragment of the secreted recombinant protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The MS data indicated the cleavage of an amino acid sequence matching the yeast KEX2-protease consensus motif EKRE. The cleavage in this region was completely abolished by the deletion of the EKRE motif in a modified variant. This modified variant was produced, purified, and used for immunization of rabbits, inducing high antigen specific antibody titers (2x10(6) ). Total IgG from rabbit immune sera recognized different stages of P. falciparum parasites in immunofluorescence assays, indicating native folding of the vaccine candidate. However, the modified variant was still degraded, albeit into different fragments. Further analysis by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing revealed a second cleavage site downstream of the motif PEVK. We therefore removed a 17-amino-acid stretch including the PEVK motif, resulting in the subsequent production of the full-length recombinant vaccine candidate protein without significant degradation, with a yield of 53 mg per L culture volume. We clearly demonstrate that the proteolytic degradation of recombinant proteins by endogenous P. pastoris proteases can be prevented by the identification and removal of such cleavage sites. This strategy is particularly relevant for the production of recombinant subunit vaccines, where product yield and stability play a more important role than for the production of a stringently-defined native sequence which is necessary for most therapeutic molecules.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Exocytotic release of glutamate depends upon loading of the neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters, VGLUTs. The major isoforms, VGLUT1 and 2, exhibit a complementary pattern of expression in synapses of the adult rodent brain that correlates with the probability of release and potential for plasticity. Indeed, expression of different VGLUT protein isoforms confers different properties of release probability. Expression of VGLUT1 or 2 protein also determines the kinetics of synaptic vesicle recycling. To identify molecular determinants that may be related to reported differences in VGLUT trafficking and glutamate release properties, we investigated some of the intrinsic differences between the two isoforms. VGLUT1 and 2 exhibit a high degree of sequence homology, but differ in their N- and C-termini. While the C-termini of VGLUT1 and 2 share a dileucine-like trafficking motif and a proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich PEST domain, only VGLUT1 contains two polyproline domains and a phosphorylation consensus sequence in a region of acidic amino acids. The interaction of a VGLUT1 polyproline domain with the endocytic protein endophilin recruits VGLUT1 to a fast recycling pathway. To identify trans-acting cellular proteins that interact with the distinct motifs found in the C-terminus of VGLUT1, we performed a series of in vitro biochemical screening assays using the region encompassing the polyproline motifs, phosphorylation consensus sites, and PEST domain. We identify interactors that belong to several classes of proteins that modulate cellular function, including actin cytoskeletal adaptors, ubiquitin ligases, and tyrosine kinases. The nature of these interactions suggests novel avenues to investigate the modulation of synaptic vesicle protein recycling.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Abstract Background: Arcobacters are important zoonotic pathogens and are transmitted through food and water. They are implicated in causing enteritis in animals and humans. Among the Arcobacter species, a wide genetic diversity has been documented, which reflects continuous evolving nature of these pathogens. Objectives: To genotype and to know the genetic diversity of Arcobacter spp. (Arcobacter butzleri and Arcobacter cryaerophilus) isolated from different sources in India. Methods: Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus - polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) was performed using genomic DNA of 49 Arcobacter isolates (27 A. butzleri and 22 A. cryaerophilus), recovered from a total of 506 samples of chicken meat, poultry skin, dairy cow milk and human stool as template and employing published primers. Results: ERIC sequence was found to be present in all the 27 A. butzleri isolates which were grouped into 18 subtypes, while it was present in 20 out of 22 A. cryaerophilus isolates which were grouped into 14 subtypes. Less variation was observed within sequences of both the Arcobacter species as revealed in dendrogram analysis. The genotyping of A. butzleri isolates showed presence of 2-8 distinct bands (∼150-∼1600 bp) while A. cryaerophilus showed 1-10 distinct bands (∼120-∼2900 bp). Conclusion: The present study is the first report regarding genetic diversity of Indian Arcobacter isolates using ERIC-PCR. Close clustering between arcobacters of human and animal origin are indicative of probable zoonotic significance. So for these purposes further explorative studies are suggested which would also help revealing the possibility of epidemiological relationships of different Arcobacter spp. as well as their public health concerns.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Veterinary quarterly","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Milk, Human","uri":{"id":"D008895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Observer Variation","uri":{"id":"D015588","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Public Health","uri":{"id":"D011634","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Variation","uri":{"id":"D014644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arcobacter","uri":{"id":"D020640","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cluster Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dairying","uri":{"id":"D003612","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enteritis","uri":{"id":"D004751","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"India","uri":{"id":"D007194","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poultry","uri":{"id":"D011200","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arcobacter","uri":{"id":"D020640","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25333916","title":"Genotyping and genetic diversity of Arcobacter butzleri and Arcobacter cryaerophilus isolated from different sources by using ERIC-PCR from India.","year":"2014"}

Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross Infection","uri":{"id":"D003428","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epitopes","uri":{"id":"D000939","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antigens","uri":{"id":"D000941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pneumonia","uri":{"id":"D011014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccination","uri":{"id":"D014611","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25333280","title":"Identification of Antigenic Proteins of the Nosocomial Pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae.","year":"2014"}

Previously, we found that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), directly targets a large number of genes in germinal center (GC) B cells including BCL6. In this study, we screened potential binding partners of IRF8 using a retrovirus-based protein complementation assay screen in a mouse pre-B cell line. We found that IRF8 interacts directly with BCOR and that the alpha helical region of IRF8 and the BCL6 binding domain (BBD) of BCOR are required for this interaction. In addition, IRF8 protein interacts directly with BCL6. Using a siRNA-mediated IRF8 knockdown mouse B cell lymphoma cell line, we showed that IRF8 represses BCOR and enhances BCL6 transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that a complex comprised of BCOR-BCL6-IRF8 modulates BCL6-associated transcriptional regulation of GC B cell function.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma, B-Cell","uri":{"id":"D016393","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germinal Center","uri":{"id":"D018858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interferon Regulatory Factors","uri":{"id":"D050835","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid","uri":{"id":"D054448","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"B-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D001402","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interferons","uri":{"id":"D007372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D008223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germination","uri":{"id":"D018525","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Co-Repressor Proteins","uri":{"id":"D056970","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25331958","title":"Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) Interacts with the BCL6 Corepressor, BCOR.","year":"2014"}

In this study, we used a culture-independent method, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to investigate the composition of the Streptomyces community in house dust. Twenty-three dust samples each from two sets of homes categorized as high-mold and low-mold based on mold-specific quantitative PCR analysis were used in the study. Taxonomic identification of prominent bands was performed by cloning and sequencing. Associations between DGGE amplicon band intensities and home mold status were assessed using univariate analyses as well as multivariate recursive partitioning (decision trees) to test the predictive value of combinations of bands intensities. In the final classification tree, a combination of two bands was significantly associated with mold status of the home (p = 0.001). The sequence corresponding to one of the bands in the final decision tree matched a group of Streptomyces species that included Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces sampsonii, both of which have been isolated from moisture-damaged buildings previously. The closest match for the majority of sequences corresponding to a second band consisted of a group of Streptomyces species that included Streptomyces hygroscopicus, an important producer of antibiotics and immunosuppressors.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The HA (haemagglutinin) of influenza viruses must be recruited to membrane rafts to perform its function in membrane fusion and virus budding. We previ-ously showed with Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) that deletion of the two rafttargeting features of HA, S-acylation at the cytoplasmic tail and the hydrophobic amino acids VIL in the outer part of the transmembrane region (TMR) lead to reduced raft association. In addition, exchange of VIL, but not of the S-acylation sites severely retards transport of HA through the Golgi. Here we have further characterized the ill-defined signal in the TMR. A sequence comparison suggests that leucine of VIL might be part of a cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) that is known to bind cholesterol to 7-TM-receptors. The signal also comprises a lysine and a tryptophan on one and a tyrosine on another TMR-helix and is conserved in group 2 HAs. Mutations in the CCM retard Golgi-localized processing of HA, such as acquisition of Endo-H resistant carbohydrates in the medial-Golgi and proteolytic cleavage in the TGN. The delay in transport of HA to and from the medial Golgi varied with the mutation suggesting that different transport steps are affected.

RNAi has been used to cause insect mortality, inhibit insect growth, increase insecticide susceptibility, and prevent the development of insecticide resistance. We investigated the efficacy of topically applied dsRNA to induce RNAi for five Cytochrome P450 genes family 4 (CYP4) in Diaphorina citri. We previously reported that these CYP4 genes are associated with the development of insecticide resistance in D. citri. We targeted five CYP4 genes that share a consensus sequence with one dsRNA construct. Quantitative PCR confirmed suppressed expression of the five CYP4 genes as a result of dsRNA topically applied to the thoracic region of D. citri when compared to the expression levels in a control group. Western blot analysis indicated a reduced signal of cytochrome P450 proteins (45 kDa) in adult D. citri treated with the dsRNA. In addition, oxidase activity and insecticide resistance were reduced for D. citri treated with dsRNA that targeted specific CYP4 genes. Mortality was significantly higher in adults treated with dsRNA than in adults treated with water. Our results indicate that topically applied dsRNA can penetrate the cuticle of D. citri and induce RNAi. These results broaden the scope of RNAi as a mechanism to manage pests by targeting a broad range of genes. The results also support the application of RNAi as a viable tool to overcome insecticide resistance development in D. citri populations. However, further research is needed to develop grower-friendly delivery systems for the application of dsRNA under field conditions. Considering the high specificity of dsRNA, this tool can also be used for management of D. citri by targeting physiologically critical genes involved in growth and development.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Silencing","uri":{"id":"D020868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System","uri":{"id":"D003577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pest Control","uri":{"id":"D010571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Interference","uri":{"id":"D034622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insecticide Resistance","uri":{"id":"D007305","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Double-Stranded","uri":{"id":"D012330","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Growth and Development","uri":{"id":"D048788","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytochromes","uri":{"id":"D003580","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insecticides","uri":{"id":"D007306","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidoreductases","uri":{"id":"D010088","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thorax","uri":{"id":"D013909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Penetrance","uri":{"id":"D019683","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25330026","title":"Double-Stranded RNA Uptake through Topical Application, Mediates Silencing of Five CYP4 Genes and Suppresses Insecticide Resistance in Diaphorina citri.","year":"2014"}

It is a well-established fact that sleep has beneficial effect on memory consolidation by enhancing neural plasticity. Implicit sequence learning is a prominent component of skill learning. However, the formation and consolidation of this fundamental learning mechanism remains poorly understood in OSA. In the present study we examined the consolidation of different aspects of implicit sequence learning in patients with OSA. We used the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task to measure general skill learning and sequence-specific learning. There were two sessions: a learning phase and a testing phase, separated by a 10-hour offline period with sleep. Our data showed differences in offline changes of general skill learning between the OSA and control group. The control group demonstrated offline improvement from evening to morning, while the OSA group did not. In contrast, we did not observe differences between the groups in offline changes in sequence-specific learning.

Consensus chloroplast sequences were produced by mapping sequence reads to the reference rice chloroplast genome or by de novo assembly and mapping of the resulting contigs to the reference sequence. A total of 122 polymorphisms (SNPs and indels) between the wild and cultivated rice chloroplasts were predicted by these different sequencing and analysis methods. Of these, a total of 102 polymorphisms including 90 SNPs were predicted by both platforms. Indels were more variable with different sequencing methods, with almost all discrepancies found in homopolymers. The Ion Torrent platform gave no apparent false SNP but was less reliable for indels.

The genes involved in PNP degradation are organized in the following three operons: pnpA, pnpB and pnpCDEFG. How the expression of the genes is regulated is unknown. In this study, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) is identified to activate the expression of the genes in response to the specific inducer PNP. While the LTTR coding gene pnpR was found to be not physically linked to any of the three catabolic operons, it was shown to be essential for the growth of strain WBC-3 on PNP. Furthermore, PnpR positively regulated its own expression, which is different from the function of classical LTTRs. A regulatory binding site (RBS) with 17-bp imperfect palindromic sequence [GTT-N11-AAC] was identified in all pnpA, pnpB, pnpC and pnpR promoters. Through electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutagenic analyses, this motif was proven to be necessary for PnpR binding. This consensus motif is centered at positions approximately -55 bp relative to the four transcriptional start sites (TSSs). The RBS integrity was required for both high-affinity PnpR binding and transcriptional activation of pnpA, pnpB and pnpR. However, this integrity was only essential for high-affinity PnpR binding to the promoter of pnpCDEFG but not for its activation. Intriguingly, unlike other LTTRs studied, no change in length of the binding regions with promoters pnpA and pnpB by PnpR was observed after the addition of the inducer PNP in DNase I footprinting.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Applied and environmental microbiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptional Activation","uri":{"id":"D015533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deoxyribonuclease I","uri":{"id":"D003850","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay","uri":{"id":"D024202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Initiation Site","uri":{"id":"D024363","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inverted Repeat Sequences","uri":{"id":"D055029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pseudomonas","uri":{"id":"D011549","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deoxyribonucleases","uri":{"id":"D003851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutagens","uri":{"id":"D009153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Operon","uri":{"id":"D009876","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25326309","title":"Transcriptional Activation of Multiple Operons Involved in para-Nitrophenol Degradation by Pseudomonas sp.

In this study, however, we were able to detect and characterize HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells in all chronically genotype 1a infected, HLA-A*02:01(+) patients analyzed by performing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramer enrichment. Two thirds of these enriched HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations displayed an effector-memory phenotype whereas, surprisingly, one third displayed a naïve-like phenotype despite ongoing viral replication. CD8(+) T cells with an effector-memory phenotype could not expand in vitro, suggesting exhaustion of these cells. Interestingly, some of the naïve-like CD8(+) T cells proliferated vigorously upon in vitro priming, whereas others did not. These differences were linked to the corresponding viral sequences in the respective patients. Indeed, naïve-like CD8(+) T cells from patients with consensus sequence in the corresponding T-cell epitope did not expand in vitro. In contrast, in patients displaying sequence variations, we were able to induce HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell proliferation, which may indicate infection with a variant virus. Collectively, these data reveal the presence of phenotypically and functionally diverse HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells at very low frequencies that are detectable in all chronically infected patients despite viral persistence. IMPORTANCE: In this study, we analyzed CD8(+) T-cell responses specific for HLA-A*02:01 restricted epitopes in chronically HCV infected patients, using MHC class I tetramer enrichment.

To further characterize these HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations that are not detectable using conventional techniques, we performed phenotypic, functional and viral sequence analyses. These data revealed different mechanisms for CD8(+) T-cell failure in HCV infection, including T-cell exhaustion, viral escape and functional impairment of naïve-like HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of virology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis Viruses","uri":{"id":"D006518","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis, Chronic","uri":{"id":"D006521","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis C","uri":{"id":"D006526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Major Histocompatibility Complex","uri":{"id":"D008285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepacivirus","uri":{"id":"D016174","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis C, Chronic","uri":{"id":"D019698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virus Replication","uri":{"id":"D014779","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte","uri":{"id":"D018984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epitopes","uri":{"id":"D000939","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis","uri":{"id":"D006505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histocompatibility","uri":{"id":"D006648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Viruses","uri":{"id":"D014780","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25320295","title":"Tetramer-enrichment reveals presence of phenotypically diverse hepatitis C virus specific CD8+ T cells in chronic infection.","year":"2014"}

Using a 15-mer random library on the outer surface of Escherichia coli (E.coli), high-affinity peptides were selected against a staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) protein after four rounds of biopanning. On-cell screening analysis of affinity and specificity were measured by flow cytometry and directly compared to the synthetic peptide, off-cell, using peptide-ELISA. DNA sequencing of the positive clones after four rounds of microfluidic magnetic sorting (MMS) revealed a common consensus sequence of (S/T)CH(Y/F)W for the SEB-binding peptides R338, R418, and R445. The consensus sequence in these bacterial display peptides has similar amino acid characteristics with SEB peptide sequences isolated from phage display. The Kd measured by peptide-ELISA off-cell was 2.4 nM for R418 and 3.0 nM for R445. The bacterial peptide display methodology using the semiautomated MMS resulted in the discovery of selective peptides with affinity for a food safety and defense threat. Published 2014.

When a combination of glucose (30 or 60 mM) with galactose (30 mM) was used as carbon source, β-galactosidase activity was not repressed rather was found increased when compared to carbon sources used individually. In real-time PCR analysis of mRNA synthesized on individual and combined carbon sources, repression of the lacL gene expression was not observed. This observation suggests that the strain M1 lacked normal carbon catabolite repression. Examination of nucleotide sequence of lacL identified two catabolite responsive elements (cre): cre1 located downstream near the promoter region and cre2 within the coding sequence. Each of which differed from the 14-bp consensus by a single nucleotide. In cre1, it is C in place of highly conserved T at position 1 in the consensus. In cre 2, it is G in place of C, a residue completely conserved at position 13. Since catabolite genes in Gram-positive bacteria are regulated by carbon catabolite protein A (CcpA) through interaction with DNA at a specific cis-acting cre, it is assumed that base changes at conserved position in the cre elements disrupt CcpA binding and thereby leading to constitutive expression of lacL gene.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The majority of known nucleolar proteins are freely exchanged between the nucleolus and the surrounding nucleoplasm. One way proteins are retained in the nucleoli is by the presence of specific amino acid sequences, namely nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs). The mechanism by which NoLSs retain proteins inside the nucleoli is still unclear. Here, we present data showing that the charge-dependent (electrostatic) interactions of NoLSs with nucleolar components lead to nucleolar accumulation as follows: (i) known NoLSs are enriched in positively charged amino acids, but the NoLS structure is highly heterogeneous, and it is not possible to identify a consensus sequence for this type of signal; (ii) in two analyzed proteins (NF-κB-inducing kinase and HIV-1 Tat), the NoLS corresponds to a region that is enriched for positively charged amino acid residues; substituting charged amino acids with non-charged ones reduced the nucleolar accumulation in proportion to the charge reduction, and nucleolar accumulation efficiency was strongly correlated with the predicted charge of the tested sequences; and (iii) sequences containing only lysine or arginine residues (which were referred to as imitative NoLSs, or iNoLSs) are accumulated in the nucleoli in a charge-dependent manner. The results of experiments with iNoLSs suggested that charge-dependent accumulation inside the nucleoli was dependent on interactions with nucleolar RNAs. The results of this work are consistent with the hypothesis that nucleolar protein accumulation by NoLSs can be determined by the electrostatic interaction of positively charged regions with nucleolar RNAs rather than by any sequence-specific mechanism.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Kinases","uri":{"id":"D011494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Kinases","uri":{"id":"D011494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acid Sequence","uri":{"id":"D000595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nuclear Proteins","uri":{"id":"D009687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fees and Charges","uri":{"id":"D005249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lysine","uri":{"id":"D008239","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphotransferases","uri":{"id":"D010770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV-1","uri":{"id":"D015497","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arginine","uri":{"id":"D001120","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Static Electricity","uri":{"id":"D055672","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25315210","title":"A charge-dependent mechanism is responsible for the dynamic accumulation of proteins inside nucleoli.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"LC8 dynein light chains (DYNLL) are conserved homodimeric eukaryotic hub proteins that participate in diverse cellular processes. Among the binding partners of DYNLL2, myosin 5a (myo5a) is a motor protein involved in cargo transport. Here we provide a profound characterization of the DYNLL2 binding motif of myo5a in free and DYNLL2-bound form by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. In the free form, the DYNLL2 binding region, located in an intrinsically disordered domain of the myo5a tail, has a nascent helical character. The motif becomes structured and folds into a β-strand upon binding to DYNLL2. Despite differences of the myo5a sequence from the consensus binding motif, one peptide is accommodated in each of the parallel DYNLL2 binding grooves, as for all other known partners. Interestingly, while the core motif shows a similar interaction pattern in the binding groove as seen in other complexes, the flanking residues make several additional contacts, thereby lengthening the binding motif. The N-terminal extension folds back and partially blocks the free edge of the β-sheet formed by the binding motif itself.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Lactococcus lactis has a played a prominent role in food industry from traditional milk fermentations to industrial scale processes. Extensive studies on the biochemical, physiological, and genetic aspects of L. lactis are evident from published literature. Recently, another novel species, Lactococcus chungangensis, was isolated from activated sludge as the sixth member of the genus to be discovered. To date, no study has been conducted to explore the functional aspects of L. chungangensis to identify features similar to those in L. lactis that are relevant to the dairy industry. Hence, the present study was undertaken to identify functional genes relevant to dairy application through comparative transcriptomic analysis of L. chungangensis with L. lactis. In expression microarray data, 415 genes were upregulated and 1,500 were downregulated of the total 1,915 probes analyzed. Interesting findings from this study were the identification of functional genes such as aminohydrolase and S-adenosylmethionine in L. chungangensis, which are useful in flavor production in cheese making. Probing these genes by PCR and analyzing the sequence confirmed the presence of these genes. Phenotypic analysis of these genes was also investigated by growing the strain in different concentrations of skim milk media to confirm the ability of L. chungangensis to degrade casein in milk, which is the major precursor for flavor enhancing compounds. Other adaptive and stress-response genes such as cold shock and heat shock proteins were also revealed. All experimental investigations at the functional level suggest that L. chungangensis possesses some interesting genes which are of commercial significance, especially in cheese production.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of dairy science","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Profiling","uri":{"id":"D020869","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heat-Shock Proteins","uri":{"id":"D006360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactococcus lactis","uri":{"id":"D013294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Food Industry","uri":{"id":"D019649","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Industry","uri":{"id":"D007221","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sewage","uri":{"id":"D012722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aminohydrolases","uri":{"id":"D000619","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cheese","uri":{"id":"D002611","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dairying","uri":{"id":"D003612","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fermentation","uri":{"id":"D005285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"S-Adenosylmethionine","uri":{"id":"D012436","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactococcus","uri":{"id":"D017045","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25306283","title":"Transcriptomic analysis of Lactococcus chungangensis sp. nov. and its potential in cheese making.","year":"2014"}

DNA methylation and modifications of histone tails have been studied in detail and are now known to be global gene regulatory mechanisms. An analogous post-transcriptional modification is chemical modification of specific nucleotides in RNA. Study of RNA modifications is a nascent field as yet, and the significance of these marks in controlling cell growth and differentiation is just beginning to be appreciated. The addition of a methyl group to adenosine (N-methyl-6-adenosine) or m6A is the most abundant modification in mammalian mRNAs. Though identified four decades ago, interest in this particular modification was set off by the discovery that the obesity gene FTO was an RNA demethylase. Since then, many studies have investigated m6A modification in different species. In this review, we summarize the current literature and hypotheses about the presence and function of this ubiquitous RNA modification in mammals, viruses, yeast and plants in terms of the consensus sequence and the methyltransferase/demethylation machinery identified thus far. We discuss its potential role in regulating molecular and physiological processes in each of these organisms, especially its role in RNA splicing, RNA degradation and development. We also enlist the methodologies developed so far, both locus-specific and transcriptome-wide, to study this modification. Lastly, we discuss whether m6A alterations have consequences on modulating disease aetiology, and speculate about its potential role in cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Briefings in functional genomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Methylation","uri":{"id":"D019175","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Stability","uri":{"id":"D020871","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiological Processes","uri":{"id":"D055705","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splicing","uri":{"id":"D012326","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenosine","uri":{"id":"D000241","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histones","uri":{"id":"D006657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mammals","uri":{"id":"D008322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methylation","uri":{"id":"D008745","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Obesity","uri":{"id":"D009765","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epigenomics","uri":{"id":"D057890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methyltransferases","uri":{"id":"D008780","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Yeasts","uri":{"id":"D015003","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25305461","title":"Role of the N6-methyladenosine RNA mark in gene regulation and its implications on development and disease.","year":"2014"}

The present study shows that Antarctic cyanobacterium Nostoc commune possesses two antioxidative enzymes viz., superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase that jointly cope with environmental stresses prevailing at its natural habitat. Native-PAGE analysis illustrates the presence of a single prominent isoform recognized as Fe-SOD and three distinct isoforms of catalase. The protein sequence of Fe-SOD in Nostoc commune retrieved from NCBI protein sequence database was used for in silico analysis. 3D structure of Nostoc commune was predicted by comparative modeling using MODELLER 9v11. Further, this model was validated for its quality by Ramachandran plot, ERRAT, Verify 3D and ProSA-web which revealed good structure quality of the model. Multiple sequence alignment showed high conservation in N and C-terminal domain regions along with all metal binding positions in Fe-SOD which were also found to be highly conserved in all 28 cyanobacterial species under study, including Nostoc commune. In silico prediction of isoelectric point and molecular weight of Fe-SOD was found to be 5.48 and 22342.98Da respectively. The phylogenetic tree revealed that among 28 cyanobacterial species, Fe-SOD in Nostoc commune was the closest evolutionary homolog of Fe-SOD in Nostoc punctiforme as evident by strong bootstrap value.

In Vigna species, blocks of constitutive heterochromatin were found either in the terminal or interstitial region of the chromosomes. The number and distribution of CMA(+) and DAPI(+) binding sites exhibit high chromosomal variability with characteristic unique banding patterns in all the eight taxa. A predominant feature was observed, i.e., most of the CMA(+) binding sites were in the terminal region of the short arm of some chromosomes while DAPI(+) binding sites were found mostly in the intercalary region of the chromosomes. The higher divergence in the heterochromatin blocks, as revealed by chromomycin A3 (CMA) binding pattern, in a few taxa, viz. Vigna glabrescens, Vigna khandalensis, and Vigna mungo, suggests that the processes of divergent evolution of repetitive sequences in genomic DNA involve a guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich region. On the contrary, Vigna dalzelliana had shown a prominent adenine-thymine (AT)-rich repetitive DNA sequence in terminal regions in the short arm of chromosomes while Vigna umbellata had shown in interstitial regions. The presence of prominent heterochromatic-rich regions, either GC- or AT-rich regions, does facilitate the rate of chromosomal rearrangements leading to restructuring of the karyotypes and thereby helping the species to attempt structural alterations as means of speciation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Protoplasma","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid","uri":{"id":"D012091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Terminator Regions, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D013728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Markers","uri":{"id":"D005819","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid","uri":{"id":"D012091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Terminator Regions, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D013728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromomycin A3","uri":{"id":"D014128","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, DNA","uri":{"id":"D017422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"GC Rich Sequence","uri":{"id":"D020862","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromomycins","uri":{"id":"D002865","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heterochromatin","uri":{"id":"D006570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Karyotyping","uri":{"id":"D007621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Herpestidae","uri":{"id":"D008988","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Karyotype","uri":{"id":"D059785","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25303854","title":"Heterochromatin characterization through differential fluorophore binding pattern in some species of Vigna Savi.","year":"2014"}

A medium density array for apple, the IRSC 8K SNP array, has been successfully developed and used for screens of bi-parental populations. However, the number of robust and well-distributed markers contained on this array was not sufficient to perform genome-wide association analyses in wider germplasm sets, or Pedigree-Based Analysis at high precision, because of rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium. We describe the development of an Illumina Infinium array targeting 20K SNPs. The SNPs were predicted from re-sequencing data derived from the genomes of 13 Malus × domestica apple cultivars and one accession belonging to a crab apple species (M. micromalus). A pipeline for SNP selection was devised that avoided the pitfalls associated with the inclusion of paralogous sequence variants, supported the construction of robust multi-allelic SNP haploblocks and selected up to 11 entries within narrow genomic regions of ±5 kb, termed focal points (FPs). Broad genome coverage was attained by placing FPs at 1 cM intervals on a consensus genetic map, complementing them with FPs to enrich the ends of each of the chromosomes, and by bridging physical intervals greater than 400 Kbps. The selection also included ∼3.7K validated SNPs from the IRSC 8K array. The array has already been used in other studies where ∼15.8K SNP markers were mapped with an average of ∼6.8K SNPs per full-sib family. The newly developed array with its high density of polymorphic validated SNPs is expected to be of great utility for Pedigree-Based Analysis and Genomic Selection. It will also be a valuable tool to help dissect the genetic mechanisms controlling important fruit quality traits, and to aid the identification of marker-trait associations suitable for the application of Marker Assisted Selection in apple breeding programs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Malus","uri":{"id":"D027845","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linkage Disequilibrium","uri":{"id":"D015810","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Malus","uri":{"id":"D027845","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25303088","title":"Development and Validation of a 20K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Whole Genome Genotyping Array for Apple (Malus × domestica Borkh).","year":"2014"}

RubisCOs are subdivided into groups based on sequence similarity of their large subunits (IA-ID, II, and III). ID is present in several major oceanic primary producers, including diatoms such as S. costatum, coccolithophores, and some dinoflagellates, and differs substantially in amino acid sequence from the well-studied IB enzymes present in most cyanobacteria and in green algae and plants. Despite this sequence divergence, and differences in isotopic discrimination apparent in other RubisCO enzymes, stable carbon isotope compositions of diatoms and other marine phytoplankton are generally interpreted assuming enzymatic isotopic discrimination similar to spinach RubisCO (IB). To interpret phytoplankton δ(13) C values, S. costatum RubisCO was characterized via sequence analysis, and measurement of its KCO2 and Vmax , and degree of isotopic discrimination. The sequence of this enzyme placed it among other diatom ID RubisCOs. Michaelis-Menten parameters were similar to other ID enzymes (KCO2  = 48.9 ± 2.8 μm; Vmax  = 165.1 ± 6.3 nmol min(-1 ) mg(-1) ). However, isotopic discrimination (ε = [(12) k/(13) k - 1] × 1000) was low (18.5‰; 17.0-19.9, 95% CI) when compared to IA and IB RubisCOs (22-29‰), though not as low as ID from coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi (11.1‰). Variability in ε-values among RubisCOs from primary producers is likely reflected in δ(13) C values of oceanic biomass. Currently, δ(13) C variability is ascribed to physical or chemical factors (e.g. illumination, nutrient availability) and physiological responses to these factors (e.g. carbon-concentrating mechanisms). Estimating the importance of these factors from δ(13) C measurements requires an accurate ε-value, and a mass-balance model using the ε-value for S. costatum RubisCO is presented. Clearly, appropriate ε-values must be included in interpreting δ(13) C values of environmental samples.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Geobiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Availability","uri":{"id":"D001682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chlorophyta","uri":{"id":"D000460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acid Sequence","uri":{"id":"D000595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carbon Isotopes","uri":{"id":"D002247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyanobacteria","uri":{"id":"D000458","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Discrimination (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D004192","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Food","uri":{"id":"D005502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kinetics","uri":{"id":"D007700","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lighting","uri":{"id":"D008029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Military Personnel","uri":{"id":"D008889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diatoms","uri":{"id":"D017377","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomass","uri":{"id":"D018533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinacia oleracea","uri":{"id":"D018724","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dinoflagellida","uri":{"id":"D004141","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Isotopes","uri":{"id":"D007554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oceans and Seas","uri":{"id":"D009792","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygenases","uri":{"id":"D010105","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phytoplankton","uri":{"id":"D010839","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase","uri":{"id":"D012273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Haptophyta","uri":{"id":"D058087","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25302659","title":"Isotopic discrimination and kinetic parameters of RubisCO from the marine bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema costatum.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"A genome-wide susceptibility assay was used to identify specific CpxR-dependent genes that facilitate Escherichia coli resistance to a model cationic antimicrobial peptide, protamine. A total of 115 strains from the Keio Collection, each of which contained a deletion at a demonstrated or predicted CpxR/CpxA-dependent locus, were tested for protamine susceptibility. One strain that exhibited high susceptibility carried a deletion of tolC, a gene that encodes the outer membrane component of multiple tripartite multidrug transporters. Concomitantly, two of these efflux systems, AcrAB/TolC and EmrAB/TolC, play major roles in protamine resistance. Activation of the CpxR/CpxA system stimulates mar transcription, suggesting a new regulatory circuit that enhances the multidrug resistance cascade. Tripartite multidrug efflux systems contribute to bacterial resistance to protamine differently from the Tat system. DNase I footprinting analysis demonstrated that the CpxR protein binds to a sequence located in the -35 and -10 regions of mar promoter. This sequence resembles the consensus CpxR binding site, however, on the opposite strand. aroK, a CpxR-dependent gene that encodes a shikimate kinase in the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, was also found to facilitate protamine resistance. Specific aromatic metabolites from this pathway, such as indole, can stimulate expression of well studied CpxR-dependent genes degP and cpxP, which are not components of the tripartite multidrug transporters. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for E. coli to modulate resistance to protamine and likely other cationic antimicrobial peptides in which the CpxR/CpxA system up-regulates mar transcription in response to specific aromatic metabolites, subsequently stimulating the multidrug resistance cascade.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Injuries","uri":{"id":"D013124","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Cord","uri":{"id":"D013116","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Cord Injuries","uri":{"id":"D013119","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D013234","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neural Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D058953","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Resistance, Multiple","uri":{"id":"D018432","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recovery of Function","uri":{"id":"D020127","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides","uri":{"id":"D023181","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cations","uri":{"id":"D002412","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fibroblasts","uri":{"id":"D005347","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurons","uri":{"id":"D009474","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Synapses","uri":{"id":"D013569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protamines","uri":{"id":"D011479","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25294881","title":"The CpxR/CpxA Two-component Regulatory System Up-regulates the Multidrug Resistance Cascade to Facilitate Escherichia coli Resistance to a Model Antimicrobial Peptide.","year":"2014"}

High-throughput DNase-seq assays have recently been used to detect in vivo DNase footprints across the genome. Multiple computational approaches have been developed to identify DNase-seq footprints as predictors of TF binding. However, recent studies have pointed to a substantial cleavage bias of DNase and its negative impact on predictive performance of footprinting. To assess the potential for using DNase-seq to identify individual binding sites, we performed DNase-seq on deproteinized genomic DNA and determined sequence cleavage bias. This allowed us to build bias corrected and TF-specific footprint models. The predictive performance of these models demonstrated that predicted footprints corresponded to high-confidence TF-DNA interactions. DNase-seq footprints were absent under a fraction of ChIP-seq peaks, which we show to be indicative of weaker binding, indirect TF-DNA interactions or possible ChIP artifacts. The modeling approach was also able to detect variation in the consensus motifs that TFs bind to. Finally, cell type specific footprints were detected within DNase hypersensitive sites that are present in multiple cell types, further supporting that footprints can identify changes in TF binding that are not detectable using other strategies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis","uri":{"id":"D017421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Pairing","uri":{"id":"D020029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypersensitivity","uri":{"id":"D006967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bias (Epidemiology)","uri":{"id":"D015982","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Artifacts","uri":{"id":"D016477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deoxyribonucleases","uri":{"id":"D003851","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25294828","title":"Explicit DNase sequence bias modeling enables high-resolution transcription factor footprint detection.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) is a tetraploid cereal grown in the medium to low-precipitation areas of the Mediterranean Basin, North America and South-West Asia. Genomics applications in durum wheat have the potential to boost exploitation of genetic resources and to advance understanding of the genetics of important complex traits (e.g. resilience to environmental and biotic stresses). A dense and accurate consensus map specific for T. durum will greatly facilitate genetic mapping, functional genomics and marker-assisted improvement. RESULTS: High quality genotypic data from six core recombinant inbred line populations were used to obtain a consensus framework map of 598 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and Diversity Array Technology® (DArT) anchor markers (common across populations). Interpolation of unique markers from 14 maps allowed us to position a total of 2,575 markers in a consensus map of 2,463 cM. The T. durum A and B genomes were covered in their near totality based on the reference SSR hexaploid wheat map. The consensus locus order compared to those of the single component maps showed good correspondence, (average Spearman's rank correlation rho ρ value of 0.96). Differences in marker order and local recombination rate were observed between the durum and hexaploid wheat consensus maps. The consensus map was used to carry out a whole-genome search for genetic differentiation signatures and association to heading date in a panel of 183 accessions adapted to the Mediterranean areas. Linkage disequilibrium was found to decay below the r2 threshold=0.3 within 2.20 cM, on average. Strong molecular differentiations among sub-populations were mapped to 87 chromosome regions. A genome-wide association scan for heading date from 27 field trials in the Mediterranean Basin and in Mexico yielded 50 chromosome regions with evidences of association in multiple environments. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus map presented here was used as a reference for genetic diversity and mapping analyses in T. durum, providing nearly complete genome coverage and even marker density. Markers previously mapped in hexaploid wheat constitute a strong link between the two species. The consensus map provides the basis for high-density single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) marker implementation in durum wheat.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC genomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosome Mapping","uri":{"id":"D002874","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Design","uri":{"id":"D012107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triticum","uri":{"id":"D014908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"North America","uri":{"id":"D009656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Variation","uri":{"id":"D014644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microsatellite Repeats","uri":{"id":"D018895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triticum","uri":{"id":"D014908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linkage Disequilibrium","uri":{"id":"D015810","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Americas","uri":{"id":"D000569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cereals","uri":{"id":"D002523","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recombination, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D011995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asia","uri":{"id":"D001208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mexico","uri":{"id":"D008800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triticum","uri":{"id":"D014908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tetraploidy","uri":{"id":"D057891","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25293821","title":"A consensus framework map of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) suitable for linkage disequilibrium analysis and genome-wide association mapping.","year":"2014"}

A total of 40 CR-KPs were screened for the presence of carbapenemases. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution. The modified Hodge test was used for the detection of carbapenemase production. Carbapenemase, extended-spectrum β-lactamase, and AmpC genes were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. A conjugation test was performed using a broth culture mating method, transferred plasmids were typed by PCR-based replicon typing, and clonal relatedness was investigated by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences PCR (ERIC-PCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The results revealed that modified Hodge test was positive for 28 CR-KPs, and CR-KPs exhibited high resistance rates against various antibiotics, except colistin (5.0%) and tigecycline (22.5%). ERIC and MLST profiles showed no clonal outbreak. PCR demonstrated a high prevalence rate (55.0%, 22/40) of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) in CR-KPs. IMP-4, IMP-8, NDM-1, and KPC-2 were identified in 14 (35.0%), 7 (17.5%), 2 (5.0%), and 7 (17.5%) isolates, respectively. Notably, 2 CR-KPs coproduced 2 carbapenemases simultaneously (IMP-8/NDM-1 and IMP-4/KPC-2). In vitro transfer of carbapenem resistance was successful for 11 MBL-producing CR-KPs. The extended spectrum β-lactamase genes were detected in 30 (75.0%) of these CR-KPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae due to metalloenzymes in China. Screening and surveillance of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae is urgently needed in this region to control and prevent the spread of these resistance

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase (LPAT) is one of the major triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes, controlling the metabolic flow of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. Experimental studies in Arabidopsis have shown that LPAT activity is exhibited primarily by three distinct isoforms, namely the plastid-located LPAT1, the endoplasmic reticulum-located LPAT2, and the soluble isoform of LPAT (solLPAT). In this study, 24 putative genes representing all LPAT isoforms were identified from the analysis of 11 complete genomes including green algae, red algae, diatoms and higher plants. We observed LPAT1 and solLPAT genes to be ubiquitously present in nearly all genomes examined, whereas LPAT2 genes to have evolved more recently in the plant lineage. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that LPAT1, LPAT2 and solLPAT have convergently evolved through separate evolutionary paths and belong to three different gene families, which was further evidenced by their wide divergence at gene structure and sequence level. The genome distribution supports the hypothesis that each gene encoding a LPAT is not duplicated. Mapping of exon-intron structure of LPAT genes to the domain structure of proteins across different algal and plant species indicates that exon shuffling plays no role in the evolution of LPAT genes. Besides the previously defined motifs, several conserved consensus sequences were discovered which could be useful to distinguish different LPAT isoforms. Taken together, this study will enable the generation of experimental approximations to better understand the functional role of algal LPAT in lipid accumulation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular biology reports","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Profiling","uri":{"id":"D020869","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Markers","uri":{"id":"D005819","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, vif","uri":{"id":"D016341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitalism","uri":{"id":"D014799","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Geese","uri":{"id":"D005777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poultry","uri":{"id":"D011200","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, vif","uri":{"id":"D016341","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25280541","title":"Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of algal LPAT genes involved in TAG biosynthesis using bioinformatic approaches.","year":"2014"}

In contrast to other retroviral genera, lentiviruses only rarely form ERV copies. We performed a computational search aimed at identification of novel endogenous lentiviruses in vertebrate genomes.FindingsUsing the in silico strategy, we have screened 104 publicly available vertebrate genomes for the presence of endogenous lentivirus sequences. In addition to the previously described cases, the search revealed the presence of endogenous lentivirus in the genome of Malayan colugo (Galeopterus variegatus). At least three complete copies of this virus, denoted ELVgv, were detected in the colugo genome, and approximately one hundred solo LTR sequences. The assembled consensus sequence of ELVgv had typical lentivirus genome organization including three predicted accessory genes. Phylogenetic analysis placed this virus as a distinct subgroup within the lentivirus genus. The time of insertion into the dermopteran lineage was estimated to be more than thirteen million years ago.ConclusionsWe report the discovery of the first endogenous lentivirus in the mammalian order Dermoptera, which is a taxon close to the Primates. Lentiviruses have infiltrated the mammalian germline several times across millions of years. The colugo virus described here represents possibly the oldest documented endogenization event and its discovery can lead to new insights into lentivirus evolution.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: CK2 is an extremely pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase, responsible for the generation of a large proportion of the human phosphoproteome and implicated in a wide variety of biological functions. CK2 plays a global role as an anti-apoptotic agent, a property which is believed to partially account for the addiction of many cancer cells to high CK2 levels. To gain information about the CK2 targets whose phosphorylation is primarily implicated in its pro-survival signaling advantage has been taken of quinalizarin (QZ) a cell permeable fairly specific CK2 inhibitor, previously shown to be able to block endogenous CK2 triggering an apoptotic response. HEK-293T cells either treated or not for 3hours with 50μM QZ were exploited to perform a quantitative SILAC phosphoproteomic analysis of phosphosites readily responsive to QZ treatment. Our analysis led to the identification of 4883 phosphosites, belonging to 1693 phosphoproteins. 71 phosphosites (belonging to 47 proteins) underwent a 50% or more decreased occupancy upon QZ treatment. Almost 50% of these fulfilled the typical consensus sequence recognized by CK2 (S/T-x-x-E/D/pS) and in several cases were validated as bona fide substrates of CK2 either based on data in the literature or by performing in vitro phosphorylation experiments with purified proteins. The majority of the remaining phosphosites drastically decreased upon QZ treatment display the pS/T-P motif typical of proline directed protein kinases and a web logo extracted from them differentiates from the web logo extracted from all the proline directed phosphosites quantified during our analysis (1151 altogether). A paradoxical outcome of our study was the detection of 116 phosphosites (belonging to 92 proteins altogether) whose occupancy is substantially increased (50% or more), rather than decreased by QZ treatment: 40% of these display the typical motif recognized by proline directed kinases, while about 25% fulfill the CK2 consensus. Collectively taken our data on one side have led to the disclosure of a subset of CK2 targets which are likely to be implicated in the early steps of CK2 signaling counteracting apoptosis, on the other they provide evidence for the existence of side and off-target effects of the CK2 inhibitor quinalizarin, paving the road toward the detection of other kinases susceptible to this compound.

Heterocyst differentiation is regulated by a homodimeric transcription factor, HetR. HetR is expressed at a basal level in all cells but its expression increases in differentiating cells early after nitrogen deprivation. HetR is required for heterocyst development, and therefore nitrogen fixation and diazotrophic growth. Overexpression of HetR leads to multiple contiguous heterocysts (Mch phenotype). HetR binds in vitro to DNA fragments upstream of several genes upregulated in heterocysts, including hetZ, hetP, hepA, patS, pknE, and hetR itself. HetR binds an inverted repeat sequence upstream of a few of these genes; however, HetR binds to promoters that do not contain this sequence, such as the promoter regions for patS and pknE.ResultsWe employed chromatin pull-down and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to globally identify HetR DNA targets in vivo at six hours after fixed-nitrogen deprivation. We identified novel DNA binding targets of tagged HetR-6xHis and defined a consensus HetR binding site from these HetR target sequences. Promoter-gfp reporter fusions were used to determine the spatiotemporal expression of four potential HetR-target genes. The promoter region for asr1469 was expressed transiently in differentiating heterocysts, alr3758 was upregulated in heterocysts, asl2028 was expressed in vegetative cells, and alr2242 was derepressed in vegetative cells of a hetR mutant strain.ConclusionsIn addition to identifying known HetR target genes hetR and hetP, the ChIP-seq data were used to identify new potential HetR targets and to define a consensus HetR-binding site. The in vivo ChIP-seq analysis of HetR¿s regulon suggests a possible role for HetR in vegetative cells in addition to its role in heterocyst development. The potential HetR target genes identified in this study provide new subjects for future work on the role of HetR in gene regulation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC microbiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Frequency","uri":{"id":"D005787","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II","uri":{"id":"D006938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lipoproteins, HDL","uri":{"id":"D008075","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linear Models","uri":{"id":"D016014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome-Wide Association Study","uri":{"id":"D055106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cholesterol","uri":{"id":"D002784","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lipids","uri":{"id":"D008055","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lipoproteins","uri":{"id":"D008074","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triglycerides","uri":{"id":"D014280","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypercholesterolemia","uri":{"id":"D006937","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25278209","title":"Deep sequencing of HetR-bound DNA reveals novel HetR targets in Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120.","year":"2014"}

Currently little transcriptomic and small RNAomic data are available to reveal the genes involve in the stress resistant in S. matsudana. Here, we report the RNA-seq analysis results of both transcriptome and small RNAome data using Illumina deep sequencing of shoot tips from two willow variants(Salix. matsudana and Salix matsudana Koidz. cultivar 'Tortuosa'). De novo gene assembly was used to generate the consensus transcriptome and small RNAome, which contained 106,403 unique transcripts with an average length of 944 bp and a total length of 100.45 MB, and 166 known miRNAs representing 35 miRNA families. Comparison of transcriptomes and small RNAomes combined with quantitative real-time PCR from the two Salix libraries revealed a total of 292 different expressed genes(DEGs) and 36 different expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Among the DEGs and DEMs, 196 genes and 24 miRNAs were up regulated, 96 genes and 12 miRNA were down regulated in S. matsudana. Functional analysis of DEGs and miRNA targets showed that many genes were involved in stress resistance in S. matsudana. Our global gene expression profiling presents a comprehensive view of the transcriptome and small RNAome which provide valuable information and sequence resources for uncovering the stress response genes in S. matsudana.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Insects and their six-legged relatives (Hexapoda) comprise more than half of all described species and dominate terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Understanding the macroevolutionary processes generating this richness requires a historical perspective, but the fossil record of hexapods is patchy and incomplete. Dated molecular phylogenies provide an alternative perspective on divergence times and have been combined with birth-death models to infer patterns of diversification across a range of taxonomic groups. Here we generate a dated phylogeny of hexapod families, based on previously published sequence data and literature derived constraints, in order to identify the broad pattern of macroevolutionary changes responsible for the composition of the extant hexapod fauna. The most prominent increase in diversification identified is associated with the origin of complete metamorphosis, confirming this as a key innovation in promoting insect diversity. Subsequent reductions are recovered for several groups previously identified as having a higher fossil diversity during the Mesozoic. In addition, a number of recently derived taxa are found to have radiated following the development of flowering plant (angiosperm) floras during the mid-Cretaceous. These results reveal that the composition of the modern hexapod fauna is a product of a key developmental innovation, combined with multiple and varied evolutionary responses to environmental changes from the mid Cretaceous floral transition onward.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drive","uri":{"id":"D004328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fossils","uri":{"id":"D005580","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fresh Water","uri":{"id":"D005618","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ecosystem","uri":{"id":"D017753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Family","uri":{"id":"D005190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phylogeny","uri":{"id":"D010802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Angiosperms","uri":{"id":"D019684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Flowers","uri":{"id":"D035264","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25275450","title":"Phylogenetic distribution of extant richness suggests metamorphosis is a key innovation driving diversification in insects.","year":"2014"}

In the present study, we used antibodies produced against the NH2-terminal region of TTPI (1/3NH2TTPI) and the phage display technology to find target regions to inhibit TTPI activity. As a first step, we obtained polyclonal antibodies against non-conserved regions from the 1/3NH2TTPI, which had an inhibitory effect of about 74 % on catalytic activity. Afterward, they were used to screen a library of phage-displayed dodecapeptides; as a result, 41 phage mimotope clones were isolated and grouped according to their amino acid sequence, finding the consensus A1 (VPTXPI), A2 (VPTXXI), B (LTPGQ), and D (DPLPR). Antibodies against selected phage mimotope clones were obtained by rabbit's immunization; these ones clearly recognized TTPI by both Western blot and ELISA. However, only the mimotope PDTS16 (DSVTPTSVMAVA) clone, which belongs to the VPTXXI consensus, raised antibodies capable of inhibiting the TTPI catalytic activity in 45 %. Anti-PDTS16 antibodies were confronted to several synthetic peptides that encompass the 1/3NH2TTPI, and they only recognized three, which share the motif FDTLQK belonging to the helix-α1 in TTPI. This suggests that this motif is the main part of the epitope recognized by anti-PDTS16 antibodies and revealed its importance for TTPI catalysis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Parasitology research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25273631","title":"Triosephosphate isomerase of Taenia solium (TTPI): phage display and antibodies as tools for finding target regions to inhibit catalytic activity.","year":"2014"}

The C-terminal region fragment of the ebna1 gene of Epstein-Barr virus was amplified from the standard strain B95-8 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The gene fragment was inserted into the pDC316 shuttle plasmid using the EcoRI and BgIII restriction enzyme sites. The pDC316-ebna1 shuttle plasmid and pBHG helper plasmid were cotransfected into HEK293 cells after sequencing. The soluble protein was extracted from HEK293 cells, which caused apparent cytopathic effects. The transcription and expression of the ebna1 gene were confirmed using flow cytometry and Western blotting. rAd-ebna1 titers were measured by the TCID50. rAd-ebna1 was injected into BALB/c mice at a dose of 2 x 10(8) VP per mouse, EBNA1 epitope-specific responses were measured at 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th weeks post-immunization. The target fragment of ebna1 (939 bp) was obtained by PCR, and was in consensus with the sequence from the standard strain B95-8. Cytopathic effects were observed after the pDC316-ebna1 shuttle plasmid and pBHG helper plasmid were cotransfected into HEK293 cells. rAd-ebna1 was successfully recombined in HEK293 cells. EBNA1 protein was detected in HEK293 cells, rAd-ebna1 titers reached 10(8) TCID50/mL. Specific responses to CD4+ epitopes of EBNA1 were detected in the immunized mice.
