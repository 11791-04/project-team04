{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is frequent in persons living with spinal cord injury (SCI). Conventionally, the pain is treated pharmacologically, yet long-term pain medication is often refractory and associated with side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions are frequently advocated, although the benefit and harm profiles of these treatments are not well established, in part because of methodological weaknesses of available studies. OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise and synthesise available research evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of chronic neuropathic and nociceptive pain in people living with SCI. SEARCH METHODS: The search was run on the 1st March 2011. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), four other databases and clinical trials registers. In addition, we manually searched the proceedings of three major scientific conferences on SCI. We updated this search in November 2014 but these results have not yet been incorporated. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any intervention not involving intake of medication or other active substances to treat chronic pain in people with SCI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. The primary outcome was any measure of pain intensity or pain relief. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, anxiety, depression and quality of life. When possible, meta-analyses were performed to calculate standardised mean differences for each type of intervention. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 16 trials involving a total of 616 participants. Eight different types of interventions were studied. Eight trials investigated the effects of electrical brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES); five trials) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; three trials). Interventions in the remaining studies included exercise programmes (three trials); acupuncture (two trials); self-hypnosis (one trial); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (one trial); and a cognitive behavioural programme (one trial). None of the included trials were considered to have low overall risk of bias. Twelve studies had high overall risk of bias, and in four studies risk of bias was unclear. The overall quality of the included studies was weak. Their validity was impaired by methodological weaknesses such as inappropriate choice of control groups. An additional search in November 2014 identified more recent studies that will be included in an update of this review.For tDCS the pooled mean difference between intervention and control groups in pain scores on an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS) (0-10) was a reduction of -1.90 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to -0.33; P value 0.02) in the short term and of -1.87 (95% CI -3.30 to -0.45; P value 0.01) in the mid term. Exercise programmes led to mean reductions in chronic shoulder pain of -1.9 score points for the Short Form (SF)-36 item for pain experience (95% CI -3.4 to -0.4; P value 0.01) and -2.8 pain VAS units (95% CI -3.77 to -1.83; P value < 0.00001); this represented the largest observed treatment effects in the included studies. Trials using rTMS, CES, acupuncture, self-hypnosis, TENS or a cognitive behavioural programme provided no evidence that these interventions reduce chronic pain. Ten trials examined study endpoints other than pain, including anxiety, depression and quality of life, but available data were too scarce for firm conclusions to be drawn. In four trials no side effects were reported with study interventions. Five trials reported transient mild side effects. Overall, a paucity of evidence was found on any serious or long-lasting side effects of the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is insufficient to suggest that non-pharmacological treatments are effective in reducing chronic pain in people living with SCI. The benefits and harms of commonly used non-pharmacological pain treatments should be investigated in randomised controlled trials with adequate sample size and study methodology.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Fear of falling is common in older people and associated with serious physical and psychosocial consequences. Exercise (planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength, gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists and consulted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that recruited community-dwelling people (where the majority were aged 65 and over) and were not restricted to specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke, hip fracture). We included trials that evaluated exercise interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise interventions were varied; for example, they could be 'prescriptions' or recommendations, group-based or individual, supervised or unsupervised. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. We combined effect sizes across studies using the fixed-effect model, with the random-effect model used where significant statistical heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where different measures or different formats of the same measure were used. Where possible, we performed various, usually prespecified, sensitivity and subgroup analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling.Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes.Exercise interventions were associated with a small to moderate reduction in fear of falling immediately post intervention (SMD 0.37 favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24 favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However, there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control.There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants).Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies that reported fear of falling. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions in community-dwelling older people probably reduce fear of falling to a limited extent immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed randomised trials is required, priority should be given to establishing a core set of outcomes that includes fear of falling for all trials examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic

Electromyography offers an opportunity for the surgeon to map the eloquent tissue associated with the tumor using intraoperative motor fiber stimulation. Similar to the use of cortical simulation in the resection of supratentorial gliomas, this technique can potentially advance the safety of intramedullary spinal cord tumor resection.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Glioblastomas are highly aggressive adult brain tumors with poor clinical outcome. In the central nervous system (CNS) the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most important limiting factor for both development of new drugs and drug delivery. Here, we propose a new strategy to treat glioblastoma based on transferrin (Tf)-targeted self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) incorporating zoledronic acid (ZOL) (NPs-ZOL-Tf). NPs-ZOL-Tf have been assessed on the glioblastoma cell line U373MG-LUC that showed a refractoriness in vitro to temozolomide (TMZ) and fotemustine (FTM). NPs-ZOL-Tf treatment resulted in higher in vitro cytotoxic activity than free ZOL. However, the potentiation of anti-proliferative activity of NPs-ZOL-Tf was superimposable to that one induced by NPs-ZOL (not armed with Tf). On the other hand, NPs-ZOL-Tf showed a higher antitumor efficacy if compared with that one caused by NPs-ZOL in immunosuppressed mice intramuscularly bearing U373MG-LUC xenografts, inducing a significant tumor weight inhibition (TWI). The experiments performed on mice with intracranial U373MG-LUC xenografts confirmed the efficacy of NPs-ZOL-Tf. These effects were paralleled by a higher intratumour localization of fluorescently-labeled-NPs-Tf both in intramuscular and intracranial xenografts. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the encapsulation of ZOL increases the antitumor efficacy of this drug in glioblastoma through the acquisition of ability to cross the BBB.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Oncotarget","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Central Nervous System","uri":{"id":"D002490","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nervous System","uri":{"id":"D009420","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood-Brain Barrier","uri":{"id":"D001812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tumor Burden","uri":{"id":"D047368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transplantation, Heterologous","uri":{"id":"D014183","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Autonomy","uri":{"id":"D026684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nanoparticles","uri":{"id":"D053758","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heterografts","uri":{"id":"D064593","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transferrin","uri":{"id":"D014168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transferrins","uri":{"id":"D061250","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431953","title":"Medical treatment of orthotopic glioblastoma with transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles encapsulating zoledronic acid.","year":"2014"}

The aim of this study was investigate oral health behaviour (tooth brushing and dental attendance) and associated factors in low, middle and high income countries. Using anonymous questionnaires, data were collected from 19,560 undergraduate university students (mean age 20.8, SD = 2.8) from 27 universities in 26 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Results indicate that 67.2% of students reported to brush their teeth twice or more times a day, 28.8% about once a day and 4.0% never. Regarding dental check-up visit, 16.3% reported twice a year, 25.6% once a year, 33.9% rarely and 24.3% never. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, being a male, coming from a wealthy or quite well off family background, living in low income or lower middle income, weak beliefs in the importance of regular tooth brushing, depression and PTSD symptoms, tobacco use and frequent gambling, low physical activity, and low daily meal and snacks frequency were associated with inadequate tooth brushing (<twice daily). Further, being a male, older age, coming from a not well off or poor family background, living in low income or lower middle income, weak beliefs in the importance of regular tooth brushing, PTSD symptoms, illicit drug use, low physical activity, and low daily snacks frequency, skipping breakfast and inadequate fruit and vegetables consumption were associated with less than one annual dental care visit. Oral health behaviour among the students was found to be low. Various risk factors identified can be used to guide interventions to improve oral health behaviour among university students.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate adult-child caregiver burden in heart failure (HF) patients. Secondary purpose of the study was to identify the possible influencing factors for caregiver burden and depressive symptoms in a young adult-child caregiver group. Methods. A total of 138 adult-child caregivers and 138 patients with HF participated in this study. Caregivers' burden, depressive symptoms, and anxiety levels were assessed by using Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS), Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Results. The mean ZCBS scores of the female caregivers were significantly higher than male caregivers. Approximately one-third of the adult-child caregivers had at least mild depressive symptoms. Caregivers with higher depressive symptoms had higher levels of caregiver burden. There were positive correlations between caregiving time, severity of depressive symptoms, and perceived caregiver burden. There was a negative correlation between education level of caregivers and perceived caregiver burden. Age, socioeconomic level, and marital status of patients were affecting factors for depressive symptoms in caregivers. Among caregiver characteristics, gender, marital status, and ZCBS scores seem to influence the depression in caregivers. Conclusions. The study findings suggest significant levels of burden and depressive symptoms even in adult-child caregivers of HF patients.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"TheScientificWorldJournal","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Failure","uri":{"id":"D006333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Marital Status","uri":{"id":"D017533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caregivers","uri":{"id":"D017028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431793","title":"Burden and depressive symptoms associated with adult-child caregiving for individuals with heart failure.","year":"2014"}

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a large cystic pituitary mass (18 × 18 × 12 mm) extending suprasellarly to the optic chiasm. Transsphenoidal surgery revealed that the pituitary tumor was Rathke's cleft cyst. Following surgery, replacement with neither glucocorticoid nor desmopressin was needed any more. Therefore, it is suggested that Rathke's cleft cyst is responsible for the masked diabetes insipidus and the central insufficiency. Furthermore, it is speculated that thyrotoxicosis with painless thyroiditis might induce changes from subclinical adrenal insufficiency to transiently overt insufficiency.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Case reports in endocrinology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pituitary Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010911","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Weight Loss","uri":{"id":"D015431","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Administration, Intranasal","uri":{"id":"D000281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adrenal Insufficiency","uri":{"id":"D000309","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diabetes Insipidus","uri":{"id":"D003919","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Optic Chiasm","uri":{"id":"D009897","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Central Nervous System Cysts","uri":{"id":"D020863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glucocorticoids","uri":{"id":"D005938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thyroid Gland","uri":{"id":"D013961","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thyroiditis","uri":{"id":"D013966","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Appetite","uri":{"id":"D001066","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deamino Arginine Vasopressin","uri":{"id":"D003894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache","uri":{"id":"D006261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polyuria","uri":{"id":"D011141","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thyrotoxicosis","uri":{"id":"D013971","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431697","title":"A Case of Rathke's Cleft Cyst Associated with Transient Central Adrenal Insufficiency and Masked Diabetes Insipidus.","year":"2014"}

Ulcer status, mortality and amputations were also assessed at six months follow-up. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of people attending outpatient podiatry clinics at a major tertiary referral hospital. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Diabetes self-care was assessed using the Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities (SDSCA) measure. Health-related quality of life was measured using the physical component summary score (PCS) and the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-12. RESULTS: Of the 60 participants in the study 14 (23.3%) reported mild symptoms of depression (PHQ score 5-9) and 17 (28.3%) moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ score > 9). Twenty-one (35%) met the criteria for previously recognized depression (on antidepressants and/or a diagnosis of depression in the last 12 months) and 17 (28.3%) for depression not previously recognized (PHQ > 4). Seventeen (28%) participants had been receiving antidepressant treatment for a median duration of 104 weeks (IQR 20, 494 weeks). Despite antidepressant treatment 12 participants (70.6% of those taking antidepressants) still reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms at the time of the study. Patients with PHQ scores > 4 reported poorer adherence to diabetes self-care activities including general diet, exercise, blood sugar monitoring and foot care when compared to those participants with PHQ scores < 5. No association was found between physical functioning (PCS) and depressive symptoms. Decreasing mental wellbeing (MCS) was associated with increasing depressive symptoms. At six months follow-up, there were three deaths and three amputations in participants with PHQ scores > 4 compared with no deaths and 2 amputations in participants with PHQ scores < 5. There was no association between depressive symptoms and ulcer healing or ulcer recurrence at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms both recognized and unrecognized in people with diabetes and foot ulcers. Depressive symptoms were associated with overall poorer diabetes self-management and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There was no association between depressive symptoms and ulcer outcomes at six-months follow-up.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of foot and ankle

A study examined how anhedonic depressive symptoms, measured continuously across a wide range of severity, influenced the physiological mobilization of effort during a cognitive task. Using motivational intensity theory as a guide, we expected that the diminished incentive value associated with anhedonic depressive symptoms would reduce effort during a \"do your best\" challenge (also known as an unfixed or self-paced challenge), in which effort is a function of the value of achieving the task's goal. Using impedance cardiography, two cardiac autonomic responses were assessed: pre-ejection period (PEP), a measure of sympathetic activity and our primary measure of interest, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic activity. As expected, PEP slowed from baseline to task as anhedonic depressive symptoms increased (as measured with the DASS Depression scale), indicating diminished effort-related sympathetic activity. No significant effects appeared for RSA. The findings support motivational intensity theory as a translational model of effort processes in depression and clarify some inconsistent effects of depressive symptoms on effort-related physiology found in past work.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Motivation and emotion","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arrhythmia, Sinus","uri":{"id":"D001146","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiography, Impedance","uri":{"id":"D002307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","uri":{"id":"D001145","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiology","uri":{"id":"D010827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reward","uri":{"id":"D012201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electric Impedance","uri":{"id":"D017097","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anhedonia","uri":{"id":"D059445","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431505","title":"Effort Deficits and Depression: The Influence of Anhedonic Depressive Symptoms on Cardiac Autonomic Activity During a Mental Challenge.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: Necrotizing and crescentic GN usually presents with rapidly declining renal function, often in association with multisystem autoimmune disease, with a poor outcome if left untreated. We aimed to describe the features of patients who have presented with these histopathological findings but minimal disturbance of renal function. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review (1995-2011) of all adult patients with native renal biopsy-proven necrotizing or crescentic GN and normal serum creatinine (<120 μmol/l) at our centre. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were identified. The median creatinine at presentation was 84 μmol/l and the median proportion of glomeruli affected by necrosis or crescents was 32%. Clinicopathological diagnoses were ANCA-associated GN (74%), LN (18%), anti-GBM disease (5%) and HScP (3%). Only 18% of cases had pre-existing diagnoses of underlying multisystem autoimmune disease, although the majority (89%) had extra-renal manifestations accompanying the renal diagnosis. All patients received immunosuppression and most had good long-term renal outcomes (median duration of follow-up 50 months), although two progressed to end-stage renal disease within 3 years.

CONCLUSION: Necrotizing and crescentic GN may present in patients with no or only minor disturbance of renal function.

(2) To identify prognostic factors for persistent knee symptoms at 1-year follow-up. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults (12-35 years; n=172) with non-traumatic knee symptoms were included in the cohort study by their general practitioner (GP) and followed for 6 years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors for persistent knee symptoms at 1-year follow-up and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated. RESULTS: Persistent knee symptoms in patients receiving a GP diagnosis of unspecified knee symptoms were reported by 41% of the patients at 1-year follow-up and by 19% of the available patients at 6-year follow-up. Patients receiving a GP diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome had the worse prognosis, with 40% reporting persistent knee symptoms at 6-year follow-up. Prognostic factors associated with persistent knee symptoms at 1-year follow-up were BMI >25, low/middle education level, bilateral symptoms and self-reported absence of crepitus of the knee (AUC 0.80) for patients receiving a GP diagnosis of unspecified knee symptoms. For patients receiving a GP diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, prognostic factors were low/middle education level, poor health, having bilateral symptoms and self-report of a swollen knee (AUC 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of non-traumatic knee symptoms in adolescents and young adults in general practice is not as good as was previously assumed.

Previous work described a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model which contains perturbations in the most frequently aberrant networks in GBM (driven by RB, KRAS/PI3K signaling and PTEN), that induce development of Grade IV astrocytoma with human disease properties. Here, we developed and characterized an orthotopic mouse model derived from the GEM that retains the features of the GEM model in an immunocompetent background, but is tractable and efficient for preclinical evaluation of candidate therapeutic regimens. Orthotopic brain tumors are highly proliferative, invasive, vascular, and express histologic markers characteristic of human GBM. Primary tumor cells were examined for sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs. PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors used as single agents inhibited cell proliferation but did not result in significant apoptosis. However, in combination, these inhibitors resulted in a substantial increase in cell death. Moreover, these findings translated to the in vivo orthotopic model: PI3K or MAPK inhibitor treatment regimens resulted in incomplete pathway suppression and feedback loops, whereas dual treatment delayed tumor growth through increased apoptosis and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Analysis of downstream pathway components revealed a cooperative effect on target downregulation. These concordant results, together with the morphologic similarities to human GBM disease characteristics of the model, validate it as a new platform for the evaluation of GBM treatment.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Disease models & mechanisms","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Delivery Systems","uri":{"id":"D016503","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Discovery","uri":{"id":"D055808","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Engineering","uri":{"id":"D005818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Death","uri":{"id":"D016923","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Feedback","uri":{"id":"D005246","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Astrocytoma","uri":{"id":"D001254","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunocompetence","uri":{"id":"D007121","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431423","title":"A preclinical orthotopic model for glioblastoma recapitulates key features of human tumors and demonstrates sensitivity to a combination of MEK and PI3K pathway inhibitors.","year":"2014"}

C-reactive protein (CRP) and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have demonstrated prognostic value in some cancers. The role of CRP and NLR in predicting outcome in pancreatic cancer after curative resection is not well established. METHODS: An electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL was performed to identify studies assessing survival in patients after pancreatic cancer resection with high or low pre-operative CRP or NLR. Systematic review was undertaken using the PRISMA protocol. RESULTS: In total, 327 studies were identified with 10 reporting on survival outcomes after a pancreatic resection in patients with high or low CRP, NLR or both. All but one paper showed a trend of lower inflammatory markers in patients with longer survival. Three studies from six showed low CRP to be independently associated with increased survival and two studies of eight showed the same for NLR. All studies were retrospective cohort studies of low to moderate quality.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association of hyperkyphosis and physical function in 2,363 men, aged 71-98 (M = 79) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. Kyphosis was measured using the Rancho Bernardo Study block method. Measurements of grip strength and lower extremity function, including gait speed over 6 m, narrow walk (measure of dynamic balance), repeated chair stands ability and time, and lower extremity power (Nottingham Power Rig) were included separately as primary outcomes. We investigated associations of kyphosis and each outcome in age-adjusted and multivariable linear or logistic regression models, controlling for age, clinic, education, race, bone mineral density, height, weight, diabetes, and physical activity. RESULTS: In multivariate linear regression, we observed a dose-related response of worse scores on each lower extremity physical function test as number of blocks increased, p for trend ≤.001. Using a cutoff of ≥4 blocks, 20% (N = 469) of men were characterized with hyperkyphosis. In multivariate logistic regression, men with hyperkyphosis had increased odds (range 1.5-1.8) of being in the worst quartile of performing lower extremity physical function tasks (p < .001 for each outcome). Kyphosis was not associated with grip strength in any multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkyphosis is associated with impaired lower extremity physical function in older men.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Being the most malignant primary brain tumor in humans, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a fairly poor patient survival after current combined treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) has been reported to have a therapeutic effect on some tumors, and we recently reported its inhibitory effect on GBM growth in vitro and in vivo, possibly through an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Here, using specific inhibitors, we found that the activation of EGFR signaling promoted GBM growth through PI3k/Akt/mTor signaling pathways. Moreover, GRh2 efficiently inhibited activation of this pathway at the receptor level. Together with our previous findings, these data suggest that GRh2 may suppress GBM growth through its competition with EGFR ligands for binding to the EGFR, and binding to EGFR by GRh2 does not lead to receptor phosphorylation. Thus, our data highlight a previous unappreciated role for GRh2 to inhibit EGFR signaling. GRh2 thus appears to be a promising therapy for cancers that require EGFR signaling to growth.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epidermal Growth Factor","uri":{"id":"D004815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, Growth Factor","uri":{"id":"D017978","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","uri":{"id":"D036341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor","uri":{"id":"D011958","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ligands","uri":{"id":"D008024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphorylation","uri":{"id":"D010766","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ginsenosides","uri":{"id":"D036145","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431263","title":"Ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits growth of glioblastoma multiforme through mTor.","year":"2014"}

Develop a composite measure of seizure control over that time. METHODS: Community-based cohort of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy prospectively followed for up to 21 years with frequent calls and periodic medical record review. Multiple periods of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year remission with subsequent relapses were recorded. Other outcomes included pharmacoresistance (failure of two adequately used drugs), early remission and early pharmacoresistance by 2 years, and complete remission at last contact (CR-LC, 5 years both seizure- and drug-free at last contact). A composite summary of seizure course was created with eight categories ranging from early sustained remission and CR-LC (best) to never achieving a 1-year remission (worst). RESULTS: Five hundred sixteen of 613 participants were followed ≥10 years. An initial 1- 2-, 3-, and 5-year remission occurred, respectively, in 95%, 92%, 89%, and 81%. Relapses followed in 52%, 41%, 29%, and 15%, respectively. Repeated remission after relapse was common. Up to seven 1-year, five 2-year and 3-year, and two 5-year remissions were recorded per participant. Pharmacoresistance at any time, early pharmacoresistance (<2 years), early remission, and CR-LC occurred in 118 (22.9%), 70 (13.6%), 283 (54.8%), and 311 (60.3%). Composite outcomes were early sustained remission with CR-LC (N = 172, 33%); later but then sustained remission with CR-LC (N = 51, 10%); one (N = 61, 12%) or more (N = 27, 5%) remission-relapse episodes but then CR-LC; various non-CR-LC outcomes (N = 179, 35%); and never achieved 1-year remission (N = 26, 5%). These patterns varied across groups defined by epilepsy type and presence of brain insults or neurodisability (p < 0.0001). SIGNIFICANCE: The seizure prognosis of pediatric epilepsies is highly variable. Most patients follow complex courses not easily summarized by remission status at the end of a period of follow-up. These complexities may facilitate efforts to understand the impact epilepsy has on young people entering adulthood.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Epilepsia","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D011446","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medical Records","uri":{"id":"D008499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epilepsy","uri":{"id":"D004827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seizures","uri":{"id":"D012640","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431231","title":"The course of childhood-onset epilepsy over the first two decades: A prospective, longitudinal study.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Objective. Education is inversely associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; however the mechanisms are poorly understood. The study objectives were to evaluate the extent to which rarely measured factors (literacy, time preference, sense of control) and more commonly measured factors (income, depressive symptomatology, body mass index) in the education-CHD literature explain the associations between education and CHD risk. Method. The study sample included 346 participants, aged 38 to 47 years (59.5% women), of the New England Family Study birth cohort. Ten-year CHD risk was calculated using the validated Framingham risk algorithm that utilizes diabetes, smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, age, and gender. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results. Regression analyses adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and childhood confounders (e.g., parental socioeconomic status, intelligence) demonstrated that relative to those with greater than or equal to college education, men and women with less than high school had 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI; 29.5, 133.0]) and 48.2% (95% CI [17.5, 86.8]) higher 10-year CHD risk, respectively. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant indirect effects for reading comprehension in women (7.2%; 95% CI [0.7, 19.4]) and men (7.2%; 95% CI [0.8, 19.1]), and depressive symptoms (11.8%; 95% CI [2.5, 26.6]) and perceived constraint (6.7%, 95% CI [0.7, 19.1]) in women. Conclusions. Evidence suggested that reading comprehension in women and men, and depressive symptoms and perceived constraint in women, may mediate some of the association between education and CHD risk. If these mediated effects are interpreted causally, interventions targeting reading, depressive symptoms, and perceived constraint could reduce educational inequalities in CHD.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health

METHODS: Enzastaurin was administered continuously once daily at 3 dose levels (260, 340, and 440 mg/m(2)) and twice daily at 440 mg/m(2)/day. Plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated following a single dose and at steady state. Inhibition of protein kinase C and Akt cell signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated. Akt pathway activity was measured in pretreatment tumor samples. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients enrolled; 1 was ineligible, and 3 were nonevaluable secondary to early progressive disease. There were no dose-limiting toxicities during the dose-finding phase. Two participants receiving 440 mg/m(2) given twice daily experienced dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 thrombocytopenia resulting in delayed start of course 2 and grade 3 alanine transaminase elevation that did not recover within 5 days. There were no grade 4 toxicities during treatment. The concentration of enzastaurin increased with increasing dose and with continuous dosing; however, there was not a significant difference at the 440 mg/m(2) dosing level when enzastaurin was administered once daily versus twice daily. There were no objective responses; however, 11 participants had stable disease >3 cycles, 7 with glioma, 2 with ependymoma, and 2 with brainstem glioma. CONCLUSION: Enzastaurin was well tolerated in children with recurrent CNS malignancies, with chromaturia, fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea being the most common toxicities.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: OTUB1 (OTU deubiquitinase, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that belongs to the OTU (ovarian tumor) superfamily. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of OTUB1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to identify the mechanism underlying its function. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty CRC samples were subjected to association analysis of OTUB1 expression and clinicopathological variables using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Overexpression of OTUB1 was achieved in SW480 and DLD-1 cells, and downregulation of OTUB1 was employed in SW620 cells. Then, migration and invasion assays were performed, and markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were analyzed. In addition, hepatic metastasis models in mice were used to validate the function of OTUB1 in vivo. RESULTS: OTUB1 was overexpressed in CRC tissues, and the expression level of OTUB1 was associated with metastasis. A high expression level of OTUB1 was also associated with poor survival, and OTUB1 served as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.

Adjuvant chemotherapy may be beneficial, but its optimal use remains undetermined. Histology and extent of resection are important prognostic factors. We tested the hypothesis that patients with midline HGG treated on Children's Cancer Group Study (CCG) CCG-945 have a worse prognosis compared to the entire group. Of 172 children eligible for analysis, 60 had midline tumors primarily localized to the thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia. Time-to-progression and death were determined from the date of initial diagnosis, and survival curves were calculated. Univariate analyses were undertaken for extent of resection, chemotherapy regimen, anatomic location, histology, proliferation index, MGMT status and p53 over-expression. For the entire midline tumor group, 5-year PFS and OS were 18.3 ± 4.8 and 25 ± 5.4 %, respectively. Many patients only had a biopsy (43.3 %). The sub-groups with near/total resection and hypothalamic location appeared to have better PFS and OS. However, the effect of tumor histology on OS was significant for children with discordant diagnoses on central pathology review of LGG compared to HGG. Proliferative index (MIB-1 > 36 %), MGMT and p53 over-expression correlated with poor outcomes. Children treated on CCG-945 with midline HGG have a worse prognosis when compared to the entire group.

The most commonly reported associated difficulties were bullying, low mood/depression and self-harming. There was a gender difference on some of the associated difficulties with reports of self-harm being significantly more common in the natal females and autism spectrum conditions being significantly more common in the natal males. The findings also showed that many of the difficulties increased with age. Findings regarding demographic variables, gender dysphoria, sexual orientation and family features are reported, and limitations and implications of the cross-sectional study are discussed.

Lateral preference (hand, foot, eye and ear) and neurobehavioral features [intelligence quotient (IQ), sociability, visuospatial construction, narrative skills and behavior] were assessed by a battery of tests and parental interviews. A large proportion of WBS individuals showed either left or mixed handedness (26 and 19 %, respectively). Hand, foot and ear lateral preference showed significant association with IQ, with individuals with mixed lateral preference presenting lower general IQ, especially verbal IQ, with respect to subjects with well-defined laterality. Approachability, visuospatial ability, behavior problems or molecular variants were not associated with lateral preference.

In `under-fives¿, acute asthma and pneumonia have similar clinical presentation and most children with acute respiratory symptoms are diagnosed with pneumonia according to the WHO criteria. The mortality associated with acute respiratory diseases in Uganda is high but improving, dropping from 24% in 2004 to 11.9% in 2012. We describe the immediate clinical outcomes of children with acute asthma and pneumonia and document the factors associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality.MethodsWe enrolled 614 children aged 2 to 59 months with acute respiratory symptoms presenting at the emergency paediatric unit of Mulago hospital. Clinical histories, physical examination, blood and radiological tests were done. Children with asthma and bronchiolitis were collectively referred to as `Asthma syndrome¿. Hospitalized children were monitored every 12 hours for a maximum of 7 days. Survival analysis was done to compare outcome of children with asthma and pneumonia. Cox regression analysis was done to determine factors associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality.ResultsOverall mortality was 3.6%. The highest case fatality was due to pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (2/4) and pulmonary tuberculosis (2/7). None of the children with asthma syndrome died. Children with `asthma syndrome¿ had a significantly shorter hospital stay compared to those with pneumonia (p<0.001). Factors independently associated with mortality included hypoxemia (HR¿=¿10.7, 95% CI 1.4- 81.1) and severe malnutrition (HR¿=¿5.7, 95% CI 2.1- 15.8). Factors independently associated with prolonged hospitalization among children with asthma syndrome included age less than 12 months (RR¿=¿1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4), hypoxemia (RR¿=¿1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), and severe malnutrition (RR¿=¿1.5 95% CI 1.3-1.8). Similar factors were associated with long duration of hospital stay among children with pneumonia.ConclusionThis study identified a sharp decline in acute respiratory mortality compared to the previous studies in Mulago hospital. This may be related to focus on and treatment of asthma in this study, and will be analysed in a later study. Bacterial pneumonia is still associated with high case fatality. Hypoxemia, severe malnutrition, and being an infant were associated with poor prognosis among children with acute asthma and pneumonia and need to be addressed in the management

Evidence is mixed regarding the effects of allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) for patients with FLT3/ITD AML. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of FLT3/ITD AML patients receiving HCT. A search of PubMed, Embase, Pubmed, OVID yielded 1706 abstracts, two researchers screening the trials based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessed the methodology quality independently. Meta-analysis showed that compared with chemotherapy, both allo-HSCT and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) can reduce the relapse rate(P<0. 01), and improve both the OS(P<0.01)and DFS (P<0.01). But when compared allo-HSCT with auto-HSCT, the OS(P=0.27)and DFS(P=0.19)have no statistical significance, only the relapse indicator has statistical significance,P<0.01. Based on the results we can conclude that Allo-HSCT is an efficient therapy approach for AML patients with FLT3/ITD. Chemotherapy can not Change the poor prognosis. Auto-HSCT can improve OS and DFS, but it can not reduce the relapse rate. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study is to determine association between COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and major depression among clinically stable out-patient COPD subjects with mild hypoxemia. METHODS: Case-control study. Cases were 30 patients with major depression and controls were 30 patients without depression. Major depression was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria by a psychiatric evaluation. All possible predictive variables were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to assess the association between major depression and each independent variable, while controlling for the sleep parameters. RESULTS: CAT score >20 was associated with major depression (OR 7.88; 95% CI 1.96 - 31.7; p = 0.004).

Material and Methods We measured the expression levels of miR-221 in serum samples from 72 CMM patients and 54 healthy controls by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The differences between the survival curves were tested by using the log-rank test. The COX proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the joint effects of several variables on survival. Results The serum miR-221 levels were significantly higher in patients with CMM than in healthy controls (p<0.0001). Patients with high serum miR-221 levels had a significantly lower 5-year OS rate (22.1% vs. 54.6%; P=0.018) and RFS rate (12.5% vs. 45.2%; P=0.008) than those with low serum miR-221 level. In a multivariate Cox model, we found that miR-221 expression was an independent predictor of poor 5-year OS (hazards ratio [HR]=3.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.782-6.777, P=0.007) and 5-year DFS (HR=2.119, CI=1.962-8.552, P=0.01) in CMM patients.

However, little is known about CC that develops during chemotherapy. We evaluated the prognostic impact of CC and skeletal muscle wasting that develops during the course of chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: The clinical data of 134 newly diagnosed NSCLC patients were retrospectively reviewed. CC was defined as a body weight loss >5 or >2 % in patients with a body mass index of <20 kg/m(2). CC was assessed at baseline (T1) and 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 12 months (T4) after chemotherapy initiation. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed using the lumber skeletal muscle index (LSMI). RESULTS: The proportion of patients with CC at T1, T2, T3, and T4 was 45.6, 46.1, 25.5, and 26.0 %, respectively. The frequency of grade 3 chemotherapy-induced anorexia was higher in patients with CC than those without CC at T2 (15.4 vs. 0.0 %, P = 0.0044). At all time points, patients with CC had shorter survival times than those without CC. Patients with low LSMIs (men, <41 cm(2)/m(2); women, <38 cm(2)/m(2)) tended to have poor prognosis. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals for CC at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were 2.53 (1.33-4.88), 1.97 (1.27-3.06), 3.86 (2.14-6.81), and 1.62 (0.80-3.16), respectively.

Despite the advances in therapy over the years, its mortality remains high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteases 1 (SENP1) in NSCLC tissues and its role in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. We also investigated the association between the expression level of SENP1 and the clinicopathological features and survival of the patients. METHODS: A SENP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was constructed and transfected into the NSCLC cells. VEGF gene expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunohistochemistry staining was used to assess the expression of SENP1 in 100 NSCLC patients and its association with the clinicopathological features and survival was analyzed. RESULTS: VEGF expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues. Inhibition of SENP1 by siRNA was associated with decreased VEGF expression. SENP1 was over-expressed in 55 of the 100 NSCLC samples (55%) and was associated with a moderate and low histological tumor grade (3.6%, 38.2%, and 58.2% in high, moderate and low differentiated tumors, respectively, P = 0.046), higher T stage (10.9% in T1, and 89.1% in T2 and T3 tumor samples, P < 0.001) and TNM stage (10.9% in stage I, and 89.1% in stages II and III tumor samples, P < 0.001). The rate of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the SENP1 over-expression group (76.4%) than that in the SENP1 low expression group (33.3%, P < 0.001). Sixty three patients received postoperative chemotherapy, including 34 with SENP1 over-expression and 29 with SENP1 low expression. Among the 34 patients with SENP1 over-expression, 22 (64.7%) patients developed recurrence or metastasis, significantly higher than those in the low expression group 27.6% (8/29) (P = 0.005). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015), TNM stage (P = 0.001), and SENP1 expression level (P = 0.002) were independent prognostic factors for the survival of NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SENP1 may be a promising predictor of survival, a predictive factor of chemo-sensitivity for NSCLC patients, and potentially a desirable drug target for lung carcinoma target

Early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) is a subtype of T-ALL with poor prognosis. Although the genetic landscape of ETP-ALL has been determined, genetic alterations related to the relapse of ETP-ALL have not been fully investigated. Here, we report the first patient with relapsed pediatric ETP-ALL to exhibit a homozygous JAK3 activating mutation, V674A, caused by acquired uniparental disomy (UPD). Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed acquired UPD (aUPD) at the 19p13.3-p12 locus only in leukemic cells at relapse. Sanger sequence of the JAK3 gene, which was located at 19p13.1 and frequently mutated in ETP-ALL, was performed in paired leukemic samples to determine homozygous JAK3 V674A mutation only in relapsed leukemic cells. In contrast, leukemic cells at initial diagnosis harbored hemizygous JAK3 V674A mutation. Further, whole-exome sequencing revealed mutations in 18 genes only in relapsed samples, although none of these was recurrent in T-ALL. These findings suggest that aUPD at 19p13.1 is partly associated with relapse in this patient. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK3 may be therapeutic in such cases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of hematology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uniparental Disomy","uri":{"id":"D024182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Determinism","uri":{"id":"D033141","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D054198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid","uri":{"id":"D054504","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia","uri":{"id":"D007938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D054218","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430085","title":"Identification of a homozygous JAK3 V674A mutation caused by acquired uniparental disomy in a relapsed early T-cell precursor ALL patient.","year":"2014"}

Only high-dose melphalan with auto-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has shown high long-term hematological response rates, but combinations with novel agents, including bortezomib or lenalidomide, have recently shown high hematological response rates for AL amyloidosis patients. In the present study, we treated eight Japanese patients with AL amyloidosis using bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CyBorD). Overall response rate was 100 %; four patients (50 %) had complete remissions (CR), two (25 %) had very good partial responses, and two (25 %) had partial responses. Five of six patients (83 %) had organ responses in the heart and/or kidney. A relapsed patient repeatedly achieved CR with the CyBorD treatment. One patient died of sudden cardiac arrest a month after normalization of his serum free light chain level, which may be attributable to his spending the previous 6 months undergoing PBSCT collection and high-dose melphalan with auto-PBSCT. Altogether, the CyBorD regimen achieved high levels of hematological responses relatively quickly (within 2-3 months). The CyBorD regimen, rather than high-dose melphalan treatment, could serve as a first-line therapy for Japanese patients with ALA.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of hematology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Cells","uri":{"id":"D001773","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retrospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D012189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D013234","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Transplantation","uri":{"id":"D017690","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transplants","uri":{"id":"D019737","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cell Transplantation","uri":{"id":"D033581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rare Diseases","uri":{"id":"D035583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Arrest","uri":{"id":"D006323","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance","uri":{"id":"D008998","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multiple Myeloma","uri":{"id":"D009101","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Paraproteinemias","uri":{"id":"D010265","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Death, Sudden, Cardiac","uri":{"id":"D016757","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kidney","uri":{"id":"D007668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Melphalan","uri":{"id":"D008558","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Autonomy","uri":{"id":"D026684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amyloidosis","uri":{"id":"D000686","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyclophosphamide","uri":{"id":"D003520","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dexamethasone","uri":{"id":"D003907","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia","uri":{"id":"D008258","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430082","title":"Combined use of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone induces favorable hematological and organ responses in Japanese patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis: a single-institution retrospective study.","year":"2014"}

We present a case that appears to contradict this widely accepted belief. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old Japanese man with tinnitus visited our hospital. His initial best-corrected visual acuity in either eye was not impaired, although they both exhibited papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal a mass or hemorrhagic lesion in our patient's brain. Nevertheless, his best-corrected visual acuity gradually deteriorated over the following three months. Angiography demonstrated a dural arteriovenous fistula in his sigmoid sinus. After embolization therapy, the papilledema improved in both eyes. However, over the subsequent four years, his best-corrected visual acuity progressively deteriorated due to an unknown cause, despite the successful embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistula.

We evaluated the role of peer social support at medical schools in the association between psychological distress and academic self-perception.MethodsAn online survey was conducted in a medical degree program for 138 international students educated in English in the Czech Republic. The Medical Student Well-Being Index was used to define the students¿ psychological distress. Perceived peer social support was investigated with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Poor academic self-perception was defined as the lowest 30% of a subscale score of the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure. Analyses evaluated the presence of additive interactions between psychological distress and peer social support on poor academic self-perception, adjusted for possible confounders.ResultsBoth psychological distress and low peer social support were negatively associated with poor academic self-perception, adjusted for local language proficiency and social support from family. Students with psychological distress and low peer social support had an odds ratio of 11.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1¿56.6) for poor academic self-perception as compared with those without distress who had high peer social support. The presence of an additive interaction was confirmed in that the joint association was four times as large as what would have been expected to be on summing the individual risks of psychological distress and low peer social support (synergy index =4.5, 95% CI: 1.3¿14.9).ConclusionsPsychological distress and low peer social support may synergistically increase the probability of poor academic self-perception among international medical students.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cross-sectional mapping analysis of HIV knowledge in Zambézia Province, Mozambique to examine spatial patterns of HIV knowledge and associated household characteristics. METHODS: A population-based cluster survey was administered in 2010; data were analyzed from 201 enumeration areas in three geographically diverse districts: Alto Molócuè, Morrumbala, and Namacurra. We assessed HIV knowledge scores (0 to 9 points) using previously validated assessment tools. Using geographic information systems (GIS), we mapped hotspots of high and low HIV knowledge. Our multivariable linear regression model estimated HIV knowledge associations with distance to nearest clinic offering antiretroviral therapy, respondent age, education, household size, number of children under five, numeracy, literacy, and district of residence. RESULTS: We found little overall HIV knowledge in all three districts. People in Alto Molócuè knew comparatively most about HIV, with a median score of 3 (IQR 2-5) and 22 of 51 (43%) enumeration areas scoring ≥ 4 out of 9 points. Namacurra district, closest to the capital city and expected to have the best HIV knowledge levels, had a median score of 1 (IQR 0-3) and only 3 of 57 (5%) enumeration areas scoring ≥ 4 points. More HIV knowledge was associated with more education, age, household size, numeracy, and proximity to a health facility offering antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: HIV knowledge is critical for its prevention and treatment.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: R0 resection, Pringle maneuver, intraoperative massive blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion have been definitely recognized to be surgery-related risk factors of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the post-operative risk factors of recurrence of HCC after control of the above mentioned risk factors. METHODS: 288 consecutive HCC patients underwent hepatectomy with selective regional vascular occlusion by the same surgical team. All patients had R0 resection, less than 800 ml blood loss and had no perioperative blood transfusion. The clinical and pathological factors were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The total 1-year, 3-year and 5-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) was 74.9%, 49.3% and 34.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that serum gamma-glutamyl-transferase rise >55 U/L, AFP > 400 ng/ml, tumor diameter >5 cm, multi-focal lesions, satellite nodules, poor differentiation, microvascular invasion, envelope invasion, postoperative liver insufficiency, preoperative TACE and postoperative TACE were significantly associated with poor DFS. Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that tumor size, satellite nodules, poor differentiation, microvascular invasion and postoperative liver insufficiency were independent prognostic predictors associated with shorter DFS. According to the results of multivariate Cox analysis of 158 cases with at least one risk factor selected from the whole group, further analysis demonstrated that perioperative TACE was not significantly associated with the median DFS (P > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Selective regional vascular occlusion may effectively control the surgiury-related risk factors of recurrence of HCC. Tumor features are the main affecting factors of DFS. Preoperative or postoperative TACE do not benefit patients who received curative resection.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Transfusion","uri":{"id":"D001803","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","uri":{"id":"D006528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival Rate","uri":{"id":"D015996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease-Free Survival","uri":{"id":"D018572","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatic Insufficiency","uri":{"id":"D048550","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"gamma-Glutamyltransferase","uri":{"id":"D005723","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatectomy","uri":{"id":"D006498","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430033","title":"[Analysis of risk factors of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after control of surgical-risk-factors].","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer in improving quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy and knowledge and in reducing distress, uncertainty and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for trials using a range of electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO to October 2013, together with handsearching of journals and reference lists. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if they included psychosocial interventions that explicitly used one or a combination of the following approaches: cognitive behavioural, psycho-educational, supportive and counselling. Interventions had to be delivered or facilitated by trained or lay personnel. Our outcomes were an improvement in quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy and knowledge and a reduction in distress, uncertainty and depression. We analysed data using standardised mean differences (SMDs), random-effects models and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Nineteen studies with a total of 3204 men, with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, comparing psychosocial interventions versus usual care were included in this review. Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a small, statistically significant improvement in the physical component of general health-related quality of life (GHQoL) at end of intervention. There was no clear evidence of benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for the mental component of GHQoL at end of intervention. At end of intervention, cancer-related QoL showed a small improvement following psychosocial interventions. For prostate cancer- specific and symptom-related QoL, the differences between intervention and control groups were not significant. There was no clear evidence that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in improving self-efficacy at end of intervention. Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a moderate increase in prostate cancer knowledge at end of intervention. A small increase in knowledge with psychosocial interventions was noted at three months post-intervention. The results for uncertainty (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.26) and distress at end of intervention were compatible with both benefit and harm based on very low-quality evidence. Finally, there was no clear evidence of benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for depression at end of intervention . CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review shows that psychosocial interventions may have small, short-term beneficial effects on certain domains of wellbeing, as measured by the physical component of GHQoL and cancer-related QoL when compared with usual care. Prostate cancer knowledge was also increased. However, this review failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on other domains such as symptom-related QoL, self- efficacy, uncertainty, distress or depression. Moreover, when beneficial effects were observed, it remained uncertain whether the magnitude of effect was large enough to be considered clinically important. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was rated as very low according to GRADE, reflecting study limitations, loss to follow-up, study heterogeneity and small sample sizes. We were unable to perform meaningful subgroup analyses based on disease stage or treatment modality. Although some findings of this review are encouraging, they do not provide sufficiently strong evidence to permit meaningful conclusions about the effects of these interventions in men with prostate cancer. Additional well-done and transparently reported research studies are necessary to establish the role of psychosocial interventions in men with prostate cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BJU

This study aimed to asses if serum microRNA profiles are useable as response indicators in this therapeutic setting. Fifty patients with locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction were included in the study. All patients received neoadjuvant therapy and subsequently underwent surgical resection. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major histopathological response when resected specimens contained less than 10% vital residual tumor cells. Circulating RNA was isolated from pre-therapeutic/post-neoadjuvant blood serum samples. RNA from 9 patients was applied to PCR microarray analyses Based on these findings possible predictive miRNA markers were validated by quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Depending on the histomorphologic regression, a differential serum microRNA profile was identified by microarray analyses. Based on the divergent miRNA pattern, miR-21, miR-192, miR-222, miR-302c, miR-381 and miR-549 were selected for further validation. During neoadjuvant therapy, there was a significant increase of miR 222 and miR-549. Although on an expanded patient cohort, the six microRNAs could not be validated as markers for therapy response, there was a significant correlation between a high miR-192 and miR-222 expression with a high T-category as well as miR-302c and miR-222 expression significantly correlated with overall survival. Comprehensive miRNA profiling showed a differential microRNA expression pattern depending on the histomorphologic regression in the multimodality therapy of locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction. Moreover, using single RT-PCR analyses a prognostic impact of miR-222 and miR-302c was detected. This article is protected by copyright.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: With the establishment of the 'neuron theory' at the turn of the twentieth century, this remarkably powerful term was introduced to name a breathtaking diversity of cells unified by a characteristic structural compartmentalization and unique information processing and propagating features. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, developmental, stem cell and reprogramming studies converged to suggest a common mechanism involved in the generation of possibly all vertebrate, and at least a significant number of invertebrate, neurons. Sox and, in particular, SoxB and SoxC proteins as well as basic helix-loop-helix proteins play major roles, even though their precise contributions to progenitor programming, proliferation and differentiation are not fully resolved. In addition to neuronal development, these transcription factors also regulate sensory receptor and endocrine cell development, thus specifying a range of cells with regulatory and communicative functions. To what extent microRNAs contribute to the diversification of these cell types is an upcoming question. Understanding the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes coding for cell type-specific cytoskeletal and motor proteins as well as synaptic and ion channel proteins, which mark differences but also similarities between the three communicator cell types, will provide a key to the comprehension of their diversification and the signature of 'generic neuronal' differentiation. Apart from the general scientific significance of a putative universal core instruction for neuronal development, the impact of this line of research for cell replacement therapy and brain tumor treatment will be of considerable interest.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cell and tissue research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy","uri":{"id":"D064987","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ion Channels","uri":{"id":"D007473","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D013234","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Automatic Data Processing","uri":{"id":"D001330","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Communication","uri":{"id":"D002450","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensory Receptor Cells","uri":{"id":"D011984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Endocrine Cells","uri":{"id":"D055098","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ions","uri":{"id":"D007477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurons","uri":{"id":"D009474","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcription Factors","uri":{"id":"D014157","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vertebrates","uri":{"id":"D014714","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comprehension","uri":{"id":"D032882","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"MicroRNAs","uri":{"id":"D035683","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communism","uri":{"id":"D003148","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Invertebrates","uri":{"id":"D007448","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429886","title":"Can the 'neuron theory' be complemented by a universal mechanism for generic neuronal differentiation.","year":"2014"}

Thus, there is an emergent need to invest a novel therapeutic for EOC. In this study, we defined ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) as a therapeutic target for EOC. Western blot was used to evaluate the expression of USP14 in nine fresh EOC tissues and three fresh normal ovarian tissues. The protein level of USP14 was higher in the cancer samples compared with that in the normal ovary tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded section of 116 cases of EOCs and indicated that USP14 was significantly associated with clinical pathologic variables. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that high expression of USP14 was related to poor prognosis of EOC patients. Starvation and re-feeding assay was used to imitate cell cycle, suggesting that USP14 played a critical role in SKOV3 cell proliferation. CCK-8 assay showed that SKOV3 cells treated with USP14-shRNA (shUSP14) grew more slowly than control group. Flow cytometry revealed that the reduced expression of USP14 induced the apoptosis of the SKOV3 EOC cells. In summary, our findings suggest that USP14 is involved in the progression of EOC and that it may be a useful target of therapy in EOC.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Cycle","uri":{"id":"D002453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Flow Cytometry","uri":{"id":"D005434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ovarian Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases","uri":{"id":"D064570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ovary","uri":{"id":"D010053","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptide Hydrolases","uri":{"id":"D010447","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sincalide","uri":{"id":"D012844","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Starvation","uri":{"id":"D013217","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429837","title":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) regulates cellular proliferation and apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.","year":"2015"}

Although epilysin was found to play an evolutionarily conserved role in neural development, the expression and function of epilysin in malignant glioma are unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate the expression level of epilysin in glioblastoma (GBM) and its association with clinical outcome of patients. For this purpose, a total of 216 GBM specimens and 31 normal brain specimens were collected in the present study. Expression level of epilysin was determined by immunohistochemistry assay and immunoreactivity score system. MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/2 mutation status in GBM were also evaluated. Results showed that the positive rate of epilysin staining in GBM was significantly elevated compared with that in normal brain. Positive epilysin staining was associated with low KPS score, unmethylated MGMT promoter and wild-type IDH. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with GBM of positive epilysin staining were more likely to have unfavorable overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that epilysin was an independent and significant prognostic marker of GBM. These results proved for the first time that epilysin expression was significantly elevated in GBM and can be potentially used to predict prognosis in patients with GBM.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioma","uri":{"id":"D005910","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Matrix Metalloproteinases","uri":{"id":"D020782","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kaplan-Meier Estimate","uri":{"id":"D053208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioma","uri":{"id":"D005910","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methylation","uri":{"id":"D008745","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metalloproteases","uri":{"id":"D045726","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429835","title":"Epilysin is overexpressed in glioblastoma and related to clinical outcome of patients.","year":"2015"}

The proportion of EGFR-, CD44-, and CD24-positive cases was 59.0, 62.3, and 30.9 %, respectively. The proportion of CD44-positive [76.9 % (p < 0.05)] and EGFR-positive [67.2 % (p = 0.108)] cases in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) group was higher than that of the non-TNBC group. In the non-TNBC group, 36.5 % was CD24-positive, higher than that in the TNBC group but not statistically significant. The proportion of CD44-positive cases was significantly higher in the EGFR-positive group than in the EGFR-negative group (p = 0.017). EGFR-positive cases were significantly correlated with premenopausal status (p = 0.036), distant metastasis (p = 0.018), and estrogen receptor-negative status (p = 0.020).

The need to save natural teeth has prompted the development of novel and complex techniques in endodontology, prosthodontics and periodontology. Despite a poor long-term prognosis and some prejudice to local bone, considerable efforts have been exerted for the realization of these techniques. Nowadays, the 3D finite element analysis (FEA) is one of the more recently used techniques for stress analysis in single human tooth under different loading cases. The von Mises stress distribution indicated that the greatest effort area of tooth lies at the base of crown up to the gingival line with varying intensities in the different loading cases. The highest stress in the cortical bone was predominantly found around the cervical region of the tooth and lowest in the cancellous bone and periodontal ligament (PDL). The PDL is a soft tissue, and it could function as an intermediate cushion element which absorbs the impact force and uniformly transfers the occlusal forces into the surrounding bone.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Materials science & engineering.

A sample of 2100 undergraduate students from nine institutions (six universities, three colleges) located in seven cities in Libya completed a general health questionnaire. The most prevalent symptoms were headaches, depressive mood, difficulties to concentrate and sleep disorder/insomnia that have been reported by 50%-60% of the students. The majority of students (62%) reported having had three or more symptoms sometimes or very often in the last 12 months. There was a positive association between perceived stressors and health symptoms, which remained significant after adjustment for gender and many other relevant factors for headache (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.15-2.02), depressive mood (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.64-2.94) and sleep disorder/ insomnia (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19-2.03).

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Purpose: Brain shift and tissue deformation during surgery for intracranial lesions are the main actual limitations of neuro-navigation (NN), which currently relies mainly on preoperative imaging. Ultrasound (US), being a real-time imaging modality, is becoming progressively more widespread during neurosurgical procedures, but most neurosurgeons, trained on axial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices, lack specific US training and have difficulties recognizing anatomic structures with the same confidence as in preoperative imaging. Therefore real-time intraoperative fusion imaging (FI) between preoperative imaging and intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) for virtual navigation (VN) is highly desirable. We describe our procedure for real-time navigation during surgery for different cerebral lesions. Materials and Methods: We performed fusion imaging with virtual navigation for patients undergoing surgery for brain lesion removal using an ultrasound-based real-time neuro-navigation system that fuses intraoperative cerebral ultrasound with preoperative MRI and simultaneously displays an MRI slice coplanar to an ioUS image. Results: 58 patients underwent surgery at our institution for intracranial lesion removal with image guidance using a US system equipped with fusion imaging for neuro-navigation. In all cases the initial (external) registration error obtained by the corresponding anatomical landmark procedure was below 2 mm and the craniotomy was correctly placed. The transdural window gave satisfactory US image quality and the lesion was always detectable and measurable on both axes. Brain shift/deformation correction has been successfully employed in 42 cases to restore the co-registration during surgery. The accuracy of ioUS/MRI fusion/overlapping was confirmed intraoperatively under direct visualization of anatomic landmarks and the error was < 3 mm in all cases (100 %). Conclusion: Neuro-navigation using intraoperative US integrated with preoperative MRI is reliable, accurate and user-friendly. Moreover, the adjustments are very helpful in correcting brain shift and tissue distortion. This integrated system allows true real-time feedback during surgery and is less expensive and time-consuming than other intraoperative imaging techniques, offering high precision and orientation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Systems","uri":{"id":"D003199","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ultrasonography","uri":{"id":"D014463","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Navigation","uri":{"id":"D062526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Systems Integration","uri":{"id":"D018511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anatomic Landmarks","uri":{"id":"D059925","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Congenital Abnormalities","uri":{"id":"D000013","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Feedback","uri":{"id":"D005246","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tomography","uri":{"id":"D014054","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Craniotomy","uri":{"id":"D003399","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neuronavigation","uri":{"id":"D038361","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429625","title":"Preoperative Magnetic Resonance and Intraoperative Ultrasound Fusion Imaging for Real-Time Neuronavigation in Brain Tumor Surgery.","year":"2014"}

Among these heterogeneous tumors, a subpopulation of chemo- and radioresistant GBM stem-like cells appears to be involved in the systematic GBM recurrence. Moreover, recent studies showed that differentiated tumor cells may have the ability to dedifferentiate and acquire a stem-like phenotype, a phenomenon also called plasticity, in response to microenvironment stresses such as hypoxia. We hypothesized that GBM cells could be subjected to a similar dedifferentiation process after ionizing radiations (IRs), then supporting the GBM rapid recurrence after radiotherapy. In the present study we demonstrated that subtoxic IR exposure of differentiated GBM cells isolated from patient resections potentiated the long-term reacquisition of stem-associated properties such as the ability to generate primary and secondary neurospheres, the expression of stemness markers and an increased tumorigenicity. We also identified during this process an upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin and we showed that its specific downregulation led to the blockade of the IR-induced plasticity. Altogether, these results demonstrated that irradiation could regulate GBM cell dedifferentiation via a survivin-dependent pathway. Targeting the mechanisms associated with IR-induced plasticity will likely contribute to the development of some innovating pharmacological strategies for an improved radiosensitization of these aggressive brain cancers.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cell death & disease","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Differentiation","uri":{"id":"D002454","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Isolation","uri":{"id":"D010356","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Isolators","uri":{"id":"D010357","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Long-Term Potentiation","uri":{"id":"D017774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Separation","uri":{"id":"D002469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation, Ionizing","uri":{"id":"D011839","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins","uri":{"id":"D051017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Dedifferentiation","uri":{"id":"D054337","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anoxia","uri":{"id":"D000860","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plastics","uri":{"id":"D010969","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation Tolerance","uri":{"id":"D011836","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011878","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemoradiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D059248","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429620","title":"Ionizing radiations sustain glioblastoma cell dedifferentiation to a stem-like phenotype through survivin: possible involvement in radioresistance.","year":"2014"}

Twist-1 was found to be a key factor in the promotion of metastasis of cancer cells, and is known to induce EMT. Twist-1 participation in carcinoma progression and metastasis has been reported in a variety of tumors. However, controversy exists concerning the correlation between Twist-1 and prognostic value with respect to carcinoma. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine whether the expression of Twist-1 was associated with the prognosis of carcinoma patients. This analysis included 17 studies: four studies evaluated lung cancer, three evaluated head and neck cancer, two evaluated breast cancer, two evaluated esophageal cancer, two evaluated liver cancer and one each evaluated osteosarcoma, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancer. A total of 2006 patients were enrolled in these studies, and the median trial sample size was 118 patients.

In-dwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) relieve symptoms, but increase the risk of pleural infection. We reviewed cases of pleural infection in patients with IPCs for MPE from 6 UK centers between 1/1/05 and 1/31/14. MethodsSurvival in patients with pleural infection was compared with 788 patients with MPE (LENT cohort) and with national statistics. ResultsOf 672 IPCs inserted, 25 (3.7%) became infected. Most patients (20/25) had mesothelioma or lung cancer.Median survival in the pleural infection cohort appeared longer than in the LENT cohort, although this result did not achieve significance (386 vs. 132 days, HR 0.67, p=0.07). Median survival with mesothelioma and pleural infection was twice as long as national estimates for mesothelioma survival (753 days vs. <365 days), and double the median survival of patients with mesothelioma in the LENT cohort (339 days, 95% CI non-overlapping). Survival with lung and breast cancer did not differ significantly between the groups.61% of patients experienced early infection. There was no survival difference between patients with early and late infection (p=0.6). ConclusionThis small series of patients with IPCs for MPE suggests pleural infection may be associated with longer survival, particularly in patients with mesothelioma. Results did not achieve significance, and a larger study is needed to explore this relationship further and investigate whether the local immune response, triggered by infection, is able to modulate mesothelioma progression.

Methods: Survival in patients with pleural infection was compared with 788 patients with MPE (LENT cohort) and with national statistics. Results: Of 672 IPCs inserted, 25 (3.7%) became infected. Most patients (20/25) had mesothelioma or lung cancer. Median survival in the pleural infection cohort appeared longer than in the LENT cohort, although this result did not achieve significance (386 vs. 132 days, HR 0.67, p=0.07). Median survival with mesothelioma and pleural infection was twice as long as national estimates for mesothelioma survival (753 days vs. <365 days), and double the median survival of patients with mesothelioma in the LENT cohort (339 days, 95% CI non-overlapping). Survival with lung and breast cancer did not differ significantly between the groups. 61% of patients experienced early infection. There was no survival difference between patients with early and late infection (p=0.6). Conclusion: This small series of patients with IPCs for MPE suggests pleural infection may be associated with longer survival, particularly in patients with mesothelioma. Results did not achieve significance, and a larger study is needed to explore this relationship further and investigate whether the local immune response, triggered by infection, is able to modulate mesothelioma progression.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Chest","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Catheters, Indwelling","uri":{"id":"D002408","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D008175","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pleural Effusion","uri":{"id":"D010996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pleural Effusion, Malignant","uri":{"id":"D016066","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung","uri":{"id":"D008168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Catheters","uri":{"id":"D057785","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mesothelioma","uri":{"id":"D008654","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429399","title":"Survival in patients with malignant pleural effusions who developed pleural infection: a retrospective case review from 6 UK Centers.","year":"2014"}

These diseases should be distinguished because they respond to different treatments. Previous studies done in adults with HIV-TTP have recommended the prompt initiation or re-initiation of ART in parallel with plasma exchange therapy to improve the clinical outcome of these patients. Here, we describe a case of HIV-TTP resulting in an acute hemorrhagic stroke in a 16 year old female with perinatally acquired HIV infection and non-adherence to ART, who presented with severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and a past medical history of HIV-ITP. Both differential diagnosis and treatments for HIV-ITP and HIV-TTP were considered simultaneously. A decrease in plasma ADAMTS13 activity (<5%) without detectable inhibitory antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-TTP. Re-initiation of ART and plasma exchange resulted in a marked decrease in the HIV-RNA viral load, recovery of the platelet count, and complete recovery was achieved with sustained virologic

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) represents a common complication after myocardial infarction. The valve is anatomically normal and the incompetence is the result of papillary muscles displacement and annular dilatation, causing leaflets tethering. Functionally the leaflets present a restricted systolic motion due to tethering forces that displaces the coaptation surface toward the left ventricle apex. The patients present poor left ventricular function at the time of surgery and the severity of the mitral regurgitation increases the risk of mortality. Currently there is general agreement to treat surgically severe IMR nevertheless strong evidences for patient with moderate insufficiency remains poor and proper treatment debated. The most effective surgical approach for the treatment of IMR remains debated. Some authors demonstrated that coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) alone is beneficial in patients with IMR. Conversely, in most patients, moderate IMR will persist or worsen after CABG alone which translate in higher long-term mortality as a function of residual mitral regurgitation severity. A probable reason for this unclear surgical management of functional MR is due to the contemporary suboptimal results of reparative techniques. The standard surgical treatment of chronic IMR is CABG associated with undersized annuloplasty using complete ring. Though, the recurrence of mitral regurgitation remains high (> 30%) because of continous left ventricle remodeling. To get better long term results, in the last decade, several subvalvular procedures in adjunct to mitral anuloplasty have been developed. Among them, surgical papillary muscle relocation represents the most appreciated option capable to restore normal left ventricle geometry. In the next future new preoperative predictors of increased mitral regurgitation recurrence are certainly needed to find an individual time period of treatment in each patient with moderate IMR.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"World journal of cardiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Time-to-Treatment","uri":{"id":"D061665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mitral Valve Insufficiency","uri":{"id":"D008944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Artery Bypass","uri":{"id":"D001026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mitral Valve","uri":{"id":"D008943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Vessels","uri":{"id":"D003331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Ventricles","uri":{"id":"D006352","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mitral Valve Insufficiency","uri":{"id":"D008944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myocardial Infarction","uri":{"id":"D009203","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Papillary Muscles","uri":{"id":"D010210","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventricular Function","uri":{"id":"D016276","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventricular Function, Left","uri":{"id":"D016277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventricular Remodeling","uri":{"id":"D020257","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arteries","uri":{"id":"D001158","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dilatation","uri":{"id":"D004106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Displacement (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D004208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infarction","uri":{"id":"D007238","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Systole","uri":{"id":"D013599","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429333","title":"Surgical management of moderate ischemic mitral valve regurgitation: Where do we stand?","year":"2014"}

It is associated with a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options. Sorafenib, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, is the only available systemic agent for treatment of HCC that improves overall survival for patients with advanced stage disease; unfortunately, an effective second-line agent for the treatment of progressive or sorafenib-resistant HCC has yet to be identified. This review focuses on components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, its role in HCC pathogenesis, and dual mTOR inhibition as a therapeutic option with potential efficacy in advanced HCC. There are several important upstream and downstream signals in the mTOR pathway, and alternative tumor-promoting pathways are known to exist beyond mTORC1 inhibition in HCC. This review analyzes the relationships of the upstream and downstream regulators of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling; it also provides a comprehensive global picture of the interaction between mTORC1 and mTORC2 which demonstrates the pre-clinical relevance of the mTOR pathway in HCC pathogenesis and progression. Finally, it provides scientific rationale for dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition in the treatment of HCC. Clinical trials utilizing mTORC1 inhibitors and dual mTOR inhibitors in HCC are discussed as well. The mTOR pathway is comprised of two main components, mTORC1 and mTORC2; each has a unique role in the pathogenesis and progression of HCC. In phase III studies, mTORC1 inhibitors demonstrate anti-tumor activity in advanced HCC, but dual mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2) inhibition has greater therapeutic potential in HCC treatment which warrants further clinical investigation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"World journal of hepatology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cause of Death","uri":{"id":"D002423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","uri":{"id":"D006528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphotransferases","uri":{"id":"D010770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sirolimus","uri":{"id":"D020123","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429315","title":"Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition in hepatocellular carcinoma.","year":"2014"}

The authors examined this association according to poverty and race/ethnicity among U.S. preschool children. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2,290 children aged 2 through 5 years. They used logistic models for caries (yes or no) to assess the association between caries and intake of 100 percent fruit juice, defined as consumption (yes or no), ounces (categories) consumed in the previous 24 hours or usual intake (by means of a statistical method from the National Cancer Institute). RESULTS: The association between caries and consumption of 100 percent fruit juice (yes or no) was not statistically significant in an unadjusted logistic model (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.57-1.01), and it remained nonsignificant after covariate adjustment (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.63-1.24). Similarly, models in which we evaluated categorical consumption of 100 percent juice (that is, 0 oz; > 0 and ≤ 6 oz; and > 6 oz), unadjusted and adjusted by covariates, did not indicate an association with ECC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings are consistent with those of other studies that show consumption of 100 percent fruit juice is not associated with ECC. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental practitioners should educate their patients and communities about the low risk of developing caries associated with consumption of 100 percent fruit juice. Limiting consumption of 100 percent fruit juice to 4 to 6 oz per day among children 1 through 5 years of age should be taught as part of general health education.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nutrition Surveys","uri":{"id":"D009749","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Education as Topic","uri":{"id":"D010353","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nutrition Surveys","uri":{"id":"D009749","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Odds Ratio","uri":{"id":"D016017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child, Preschool","uri":{"id":"D002675","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Education","uri":{"id":"D006266","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Education as Topic","uri":{"id":"D010353","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Educators","uri":{"id":"D040441","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Cancer Institute (U.S.)","uri":{"id":"D054547","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Academies and Institutes","uri":{"id":"D000047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Continental Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nutrition Surveys","uri":{"id":"D009749","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poverty","uri":{"id":"D011203","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429039","title":"Early childhood caries and intake of 100 percent fruit juice: Data from NHANES, 1999-2004.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: The study sample consisted of 117 edentulous patients, each of whom received two mandibular implants, for a total of 234 implants. Implant-retained mandibular overdentures were loaded after a four-month healing period and followed up for an additional one year. The authors assessed implant survival and stability (by means of resonance frequency analysis) relative to glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, with baseline levels up to 11.1 percent and levels as high as 13.3 percent over one year. RESULTS: Implant survival rates for 110 of 117 patients who were followed up for one year after loading were 99.0 percent, 98.9 percent and 100 percent, respectively, for patients who did not have diabetes (n = 47), those with well-controlled diabetes (n = 44) and those with poorly controlled diabetes (n = 19). The authors considered the seven patients lost to follow-up as having had failed implants; consequently, their conservative estimates of survival rates in the three groups were 93.0 percent, 92.6 percent and 95.0 percent (P = .6510). Two implants failed at four weeks, one in the nondiabetes group and the other in the well-controlled diabetes group. Delays in implant stabilization were related directly to poor glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that elevated HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes were not associated with altered implant survival one year after loading. However, alterations in early bone healing and implant stability were associated with hyperglycemia. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Within the clinical parameters of this study, the findings indicate likely implant success among patients with type 2 diabetes who lacked good glycemic control.

METHODS: The RAMBRANDT (Repository Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) was analyzed to identify the potential MDK regulators. MDK and SP1 expression was compared in glioma specimens. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to confirm the transcriptional regulation. MDK force-expressed, SP1-silenced glioma cells were used to test the rescue effects in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MDK and SP1 expression in gliomas was significantly higher than adjacent tissues. MDK and SP1 expressions are positively correlated in glioma clinical samples and cell lines. The promoter of the human MDK gene has a putative SP1 binding site. SP1 binds to the promoter of the MDK gene and directly regulates the MDK expression. MDK or SP1 gene silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and reduced the tumor volume in nude mice.

We recently discovered that HOTAIR is a cell cycle-related lncRNA in human glioma, and its expression is closely associated with glioma staging and poor prognosis. Although lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) have been demonstrated to be functional targets of HOTAIR, how HOTAIR regulates glioma cell cycle progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that EZH2 (predominant PRC2 complex component) inhibition blocked cell cycle progression in glioma cells, consistent with the effects elicited by HOTAIR siRNA. However, the inhibition of LSD1 did not affect cell cycle progression in glioma cells. These results suggest that HOTAIR might regulate cell cycle progression through EZH2. Our intracranial mice model also revealed delayed tumor growth in HOTAIR siRNA- and EZH2 inhibitor-treated groups. Moreover, in HOTAIR knock-down cell lines, the expression of the PRC2-binding domain of HOTAIR (5' domain) but not of the LSD1-binding domain of HOTAIR (3' domain) resulted in accelerated cell cycle progression. In conclusion, HOTAIR promotes cell cycle progression in glioma as a result of the binding of its 5' domain to the PRC2 complex.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Oncotarget","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Antisense","uri":{"id":"D016372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Cycle","uri":{"id":"D002453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Untranslated","uri":{"id":"D022661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Long Noncoding","uri":{"id":"D062085","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2","uri":{"id":"D063151","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acceleration","uri":{"id":"D000054","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioma","uri":{"id":"D005910","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lysine","uri":{"id":"D008239","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatitis","uri":{"id":"D010195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Small Interfering","uri":{"id":"D034741","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Long Noncoding","uri":{"id":"D062085","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428914","title":"Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR promotes glioblastoma cell cycle progression in an EZH2 dependent manner.","year":"2014"}

Although progress has been made in understanding signal transduction, little is known of how HER2 achieves gene regulation. We performed whole genome expression analysis on a HER2+ and HER2- breast cancer cell lines and compared these results to expression in 812 primary tumors stratified by their HER2 expression level. Chip-on-chip with anti-RNA polymerase II was compared among breast cancer cell lines to identify genes that are potentially activated by HER2. The expression levels of these HER2-dependent POL II binding genes were determined for the 812 HER2+/- breast cancer tissues. Genes differentially expressed between HER2+/- cell lines were generally regulated in the same direction as in breast cancer tissues. We identified genes that had POLII binding in HER2+ cell lines, but without significant gene expression. Of 737 such genes \"poised\" for expression in cell lines, 113 genes were significantly differentially expressed in breast tumors in a HER2-dependent manner.

Previous work showed that mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) with a mutated catalytic site (N1348A) replicated similarly to wild-type virus but was unable to cause acute hepatitis in mice. To determine whether this attenuated phenotype is applicable to multiple disease models, we mutated the catalytic residue in the JHM strain of MHV (JHMV), which causes acute and chronic encephalomyelitis, using a newly developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based MHV reverse genetics system. Infection of mice with the macrodomain catalytic point mutant virus (N1347A) resulted in reduced lethality, weight loss, viral titers, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration in the brain when compared to mice infected with wild-type virus. Specifically, macrophages were most affected, with approximately 2.5-fold fewer macrophages at day 5 post-infection in N1347A-infected brains. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) signaling were not required for effective host control of mutant virus, as all N1347A-infected mice survived the infection. However, the adaptive immune system was required for protection, since N1347A virus was able to cause lethal encephalitis in RAG1 (recombination activation gene1)(-/-) knockout mice, although disease onset was modestly delayed. Overall, these results indicate that the BAC-based MHV reverse genetics system will be useful for studies of JHMV, and expand upon previous studies, showing that the macrodomain is critical for the ability of coronaviruses to evade the immune system and promote viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: Coronaviruses are an important cause of human and veterinary diseases worldwide. Viral processes that are conserved across a family are likely to be good targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. The macrodomain is a ubiquitous structural domain, and is also conserved among all coronaviruses. The coronavirus macrodomain has ADP-ribose-1\"-phosphatase activity; however, its function during infection remains unclear as does why coronaviruses have maintained this enzymatic activity throughout evolution. For MHV, this domain has now been shown to promote multiple types of disease, including hepatitis and encephalitis. These data indicate that this domain is vital for the virus to replicate and cause disease. Understanding the mechanism used by this enzyme to promote viral pathogenesis will open up novel avenues for therapies, and may give further insight into the role of macrodomain proteins in the host cell, since these proteins are found in all living organisms.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Human aging is associated with increasing frailty and morbidity which can result in significant disability. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may contribute to aging-related diseases like depression, cognitive deficits, and Alzheimer's disease in some older individuals. In addition to neuro-cognitive dysfunction, it has also been associated with declining physical performance possibly due to sarcopenia. This article reviews the pathophysiology of HPA dysfunction with respect to increased basal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, decreased glucocorticoid (GC) negative feedback at the level of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus (HC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and flattening of diurnal pattern of cortisol release. It is possible that the increased cortisol secretion is secondary to peripheral conversion from cortisone. There is a decline in pregnolone secretion and C-19 steroids (DHEA) with aging. There is a small decrease in aldosterone with aging, but a subset of the older population have a genetic predisposition to develop hyperaldosteronism due to the increased ACTH stimulation. The understanding of the HPA axis and aging remains a complex area with conflicting studies leading to controversial interpretations. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

Data on cumulative incidence suggest a higher rate of active epilepsy than reported in lifetime prevalence surveys. This study reports the findings of that poll addressing the proposal in our Controversy in Epilepsy series that it could be from increased death rates. METHODS: The survey consisted of a question addressing possible reasons to explain the discrepancy between the incidence and prevalence of epilepsy. Another four questions addressed demographic information. RESULTS: There were 34 responders who completed the survey. Half (50%) of the responders felt that the discrepancy between cumulative incidence and lifetime prevalence was due to lack of uniform definitions and misclassification of patients in study design, 23.5% said the discrepancy was due to a higher mortality from diseases and conditions such as trauma and infections associated with epilepsy, 23.5% indicated that the stigma of epilepsy prevented people from acknowledging their disease in prevalence surveys, and 2.9% felt it was from poor access to qualified medical personal and utilization of medical treatments that increased death rates directly related to epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: Within the limitations of sample size, the results of this survey support that the discrepancy between the incidence and prevalence of epilepsy in lower income regions of the world is due to problems in acquiring the data and stigma rather than higher mortality from diseases associated with epilepsy and repeated seizures.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Epilepsia","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sample Size","uri":{"id":"D018401","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epilepsy","uri":{"id":"D004827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Income","uri":{"id":"D007182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seizures","uri":{"id":"D012640","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428806","title":"Reasons for discrepancy between incidence and prevalence of epilepsy in lower income countries: Epilepsia's survey results.","year":"2014"}

However it is still not clear if this trend applies to Eastern Europe where high incidence rate of gastric cancer is observed. METHODS: This was a retrospective non-randomized, single center, cohort study. During the study period 557 consecutive patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in which curative operation was performed met the inclusion criteria. The study population was divided into two groups according to two equal time periods: 01-01-1994 - 31-12-2000 (Group I - 273 patients) and 01-01-2001 - 31-12-2007 (Group II - 284 patients). Primary (five-year survival rate) and secondary (postoperative complications, 30-day mortality rate and length of hospital stay) endpoints were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: Rate of postoperative complications was similar between the groups, except for Grade III (Clavien-Dindo grading system for the classification of surgical complications) complications that were observed at significantly lower rates in Group II (26 (9.5%) vs. 11 (3.9%), p = 0.02). Length of hospital stay was significantly (p = 0.001) shorter (22.6 +/- 28.9 vs. 16.2 +/- 17.01 days) and 30-day mortality was significantly (p = 0.02) lower (15 (5.5%) vs. 4 (1.4%)) in Group II. Similar rates of gastric cancer related mortality were observed in both groups (92.3% vs. 90.7%). However survival analysis revealed significantly (p = 0.02) better overall 5-year survival rate in Group II (35.6%, 101 of 284) than in Group I (23.4%, 64 of 273). There was no difference in 5-year survival rate when comparing different TNM stages. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer treatment results remain poor despite decreasing early postoperative mortality rates, shortening hospital stay and improved overall survival over the time. Prognosis of treatment of gastric cancer depends mainly on the stage of the disease. Absence of screening programs and lack of clinical symptoms in early stages of gastric cancer lead to circumstances when most of the patients presenting with advanced stage of the disease can expect a median survival of less than 30 months even after surgery with curative intent.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC surgery","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Length of Stay","uri":{"id":"D007902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospital Mortality","uri":{"id":"D017052","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe","uri":{"id":"D005060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Length of Stay","uri":{"id":"D007902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Staging","uri":{"id":"D009367","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Postoperative Complications","uri":{"id":"D011183","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stomach Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D013274","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival Rate","uri":{"id":"D015996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe, Eastern","uri":{"id":"D005061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe","uri":{"id":"D005060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428767","title":"Trends and results in treatment of gastric cancer over last two decades at single East European centre: a cohort study.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: In the USA, binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of ~3.5 % in adult women, 2.0 % in adult men, and 1.6 % in adolescents. BED is characterized by frequent episodes of binge eating that are accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating and result in marked psychological distress. BED is highly co-morbid with obesity and with depression and other psychiatric conditions, and it is associated with substantial role impairment. Currently, there are no US FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for BED. Animal and human studies implicate underlying dysregulation in dopamine, opioid, acetylcholine, and serotonin neurocircuitry within brain reward regions in the pathogenesis and maintenance of BED. To date, the efficacy of various agents that target these and other neurotransmitter systems involved in motivated feeding behavior, mood regulation, and impulse control have been investigated in the treatment of BED. Several antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents have demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating frequency, but only in limited cases have these effects resulted in patients achieving abstinence, which is the primary goal of treatment; they also range from less (fluvoxamine) to more (topiramate) effective in achieving weight loss that is both clinically meaningful and significantly greater than placebo. Collectively, the literature on pharmacological treatment approaches to BED is limited in that very few agents have been studied in multiple, confirmatory trials with adequate follow up, and almost none have been evaluated in large patient samples that are diverse with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. In addition, prior trials have not adequately addressed, through study design, the high placebo response commonly observed in this patient population. Several novel agents are in various phases of testing, and recent animal studies focusing on glutamate-signaling circuits linking the amygdala to the lateral hypothalamus offer new avenues for exploration and potential therapeutic development. Studies of newly FDA-approved medications for long-term obesity treatment and further explorations of dietary supplements and neutraceuticals with appetite- and mood-altering properties may also be worthwhile.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Drugs","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Weight

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. INTERVENTION: A written self-management programme including a description of active coping strategies for daily life was provided. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CFS after mononucleosis were evaluated at Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital during 1996-2006 (contact 1). In 2009 self-report questionnaires were sent to all patients (contact 2). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary measure was employment status at contact 2. Secondary measures included clinical symptoms, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores on both contacts, and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at contact 2. RESULTS: Of 111 patients at contact 1, 92 (83%) patients returned the questionnaire at contact 2. Mean disease duration at contact 1 was 4.7 years and at contact 2 11.4 years. At contact 1, 9 (10%) were part-time or full-time employed. At contact 2, 49 (55%) were part-time or full-time employed. Logical regression analysis showed that FSS≥5 at contact 2 was associated with depression, arthralgia and long disease duration (all at contact 1). CONCLUSIONS: About half of younger patients with CFS with long-term incapacity for work experienced marked improvement including full-time or part-time employment showing better outcomes than expected.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"This review investigated three research questions (i) What is the utility of social cognitive theory (SCT) to explain physical activity (PA)?; (ii) Is the effectiveness of SCT moderated by sample or methodological characteristics? and (iii) What is the frequency of significant associations between the core SCT constructs and PA? Ten electronic databases were searched with no date or sample restrictions. Forty-four studies were retrieved containing 55 SCT models of PA. Methodological quality was assessed using a standardized tool. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed that SCT accounted for 31% of the variance in PA. However, methodological quality was mostly poor for these models. Methodological quality and sample age moderated the PA effect size, with increases in both associated with greater variance explained. Although self-efficacy and goals were consistently associated with PA, outcome expectations and socio-structural factors were not. This review determined that SCT is a useful framework to explain PA behaviour. Higher quality models explained more PA variance, but overall methodological quality was poor. As such, high-quality studies examining the utility of SCT to explain PA are warranted.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motor Activity","uri":{"id":"D009043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronics","uri":{"id":"D004581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrons","uri":{"id":"D004583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428600","title":"Social cognitive theory and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","year":"2014"}

A sample of 166 transgender adults (112 male-to-female transgender women and 54 female-to-male transgender men) were recruited in community venues and anonymously completed measures assessing these variables. Most participants (64.5 %) were HIV-negative, 25.2 % were HIV-positive, and 10.3 % did not know their HIV status. Overall, 33.7 % of participants reported having met a sexual partner over the internet, which did not differ significantly between transgender women and men. Among these individuals, transgender women reported significantly more lifetime internet sexual partners (median = 3) than transgender men (median = 1). Use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with lower self-esteem but not with depression, anxiety, somatic distress or discrimination experiences. Among transgender women, use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with each of the 11 sexual risk behaviors examined, including having multiple partners, sex under the influence of drugs, number of unprotected anal or vaginal sex acts, and history of commercial sex work. The use of the internet to meet partners was not associated with sexual risk behavior among transgender men (0/11 variables assessed). Although the internet is a common mode of meeting sexual partners among some transgender adults, it may also be a potential venue for prevention interventions targeting transgender individuals at particularly high risk for HIV acquisition.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Archives of sexual behavior","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk-Taking","uri":{"id":"D012309","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexual Partners","uri":{"id":"D012747","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anonyms and Pseudonyms","uri":{"id":"D000851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Discrimination (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D004192","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV","uri":{"id":"D006678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internet","uri":{"id":"D020407","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaginitis","uri":{"id":"D014627","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Venus","uri":{"id":"D018536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transgendered Persons","uri":{"id":"D063106","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428577","title":"Use of the Internet to Meet Sexual Partners, Sexual Risk Behavior, and Mental Health in Transgender Adults.","year":"2014"}

This study therefore assessed the prevalence and association with regular HIV testing among street- and off-street SWs in Vancouver, Canada. Cross-sectional baseline data were used from a longitudinal cohort known as \"An Evaluation of Sex Worker's Health Access\" (AESHA; January 2010-July 2012). This cohort included youth and adult SWs (aged 14+ years). We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between explanatory variables and having a recent HIV test (in the last year). Of the 435 seronegative SWs included, 67.1% reported having a recent HIV test. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, having a recent HIV test remained significantly independently associated with elevated odds of inconsistent condom use with clients [adjusted (multivariable) odds ratios, AOR: 2.59, 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]: 1.17-5.78], injecting drugs (AOR: 2.33, 95% CIs: 1.17-4.18) and contact with a mobile HIV prevention programme (AOR: 1.76, 95% CIs: 1.09-2.84) within the last six months. Reduced odds of having a recent HIV test was also significantly associated with being a migrant/new immigrant to Canada (AOR: 0.33, 95% CIs: 0.19-0.56) and having a language barrier to health care access (AOR: 0.26, 95% CIs: 0.09-0.73). Our results highlight successes of reaching SWs at high risk of HIV through drug and sexual pathways. To maximize the effectiveness of including HIV testing as part of comprehensive HIV prevention and care to SWs, increased mobile outreach and safer-environment interventions that facilitate access to voluntary, confidential and non-coercive HIV testing remain a critical priority, in addition to culturally safe services with language support.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"AIDS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: Taxane-based chemotherapy is one of the most commonly used agents in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who developed disease progression after gemcitabine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. The response rates, however, are dismal reported around 10-20 %. Recently, promising efficacy results of paclitaxel when combined with oral cyclophosphamide as metronomic therapy have been reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) intravenously over 3 h on day 1 and cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day orally on days 1-7 every 3 weeks. For patients with ECOG, performance status was two or previous radiotherapy on 25 % or more of their bone marrow, paclitaxel was given at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) for the first cycle, followed by intra-patient dose escalation to 175 mg/m(2) if clinically significant toxicities were not observed during the first cycle. Oral cyclophosphamide was administered for extended 3 weeks after the safety of 1-week metronomic therapy was confirmed. The primary end points were response rate (RECIST v.1.1) and progression-free survival. RESULTS: From March 2012 to March 2014, 46 patients with bladder or upper urinary tract cancer were treated with this regimen in our institution after failure to gemcitabine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. After excluding four patients with pathologies other than urothelial carcinoma (one collecting duct carcinoma, two small cell carcinoma, and one squamous cell carcinoma), a total of 42 patients were included in this study. The platinum-free interval was <6 months in 33 (78.6 %) patients, and 39 (92.8 %) were categorized into the intermediate or poor prognosis group according to Bajorin's risk model. The objective response rate was 33.3 % (n = 14) with a median response duration of 4.3 months. The median time to progression was 3.0 months (95 % CI 1.7-4.3 months), and the median OS was 6.3 months (95 % CI 4.6-8.0 months). The most frequent and clinically significant non-hematologic toxicities were peripheral sensory neuropathy (56 %), fatigue (35 %), and myalgia (28 %) in order, but none of them showed severity of grade 3 or more. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurred only in two patients (6 %), and one of them developed febrile neutropenia. The duration of metronomic cyclophosphamide did not significantly affect the toxicity profile, and it could be safely administered for whole cycles. CONCLUSION: Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide combined with paclitaxel appears to be both efficacious and safe as a salvage chemotherapy, particularly in heavily pretreated patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma after gemcitabine-cisplatin failure.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer chemotherapy and

METHODS: Clinicopathologic data were reviewed for patients with SOC treated with primary cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. The correlations of NLR value with clinicopathological features, clinical response to chemotherapy, and survival outcome were further explored. RESULTS: High preoperative NLR was significantly associated with advanced FIGO stage, histological grade, increased serum CA-125 level, and positive lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05, respectively). SOC patients in the third and fourth NLR quartile had significantly lower complete response rates compared to those in the first NLR quartile. In addition, survival analysis identified NLR as an independent prognostic factor for both PFS (HR 2.262, 95 % CI 1.342-3.811; P = 0.002) and OS (HR 3.254, 95 % CI 1.741-6.084; P < 0.001) in SOC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that high levels of preoperative NLR might be a potential biomarker of worse response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and poor clinical outcomes in patients with SOC.

We determined protein expression of RAB27A and TP53 in 265 pancreatic tissues (186 carcinomas and 79 normal or benign tissues) by immunohistochemistry analysis on tissue microarray and found their expression was correlated with patients' clinical parameters and overall survival. We found that RAB27A and TP53 protein expression was significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal and benign tissues. High RAB27A protein expression (RAB27A+) was significantly associated with tumor stage and vascular invasion. No correlation between RAB27A and TP53 expression was observed. Patients with high RAB27A expression and high TP53 expression had a poor overall survival. Our data indicate that RAB27A expression is an independent prognostic marker for PDAC, and RAB27A-regulated exosome secretion pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer .","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"rab GTP-Binding Proteins","uri":{"id":"D020691","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Array Analysis","uri":{"id":"D046888","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Staging","uri":{"id":"D009367","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","uri":{"id":"D016159","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Secretory Pathway","uri":{"id":"D055571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tumor Microenvironment","uri":{"id":"D059016","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenocarcinoma","uri":{"id":"D000230","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatitis","uri":{"id":"D010195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"GTP Phosphohydrolases","uri":{"id":"D020558","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exosomes","uri":{"id":"D055354","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428385","title":"High expression of RAB27A and TP53 in pancreatic cancer predicts poor survival.","year":"2015"}

MicroRNAs have florid biological functions and play critical roles in the pathogenesis and prognosis in AML. Expression levels of some single microRNAs are influential for prognosis, but a system integrating several together and considering the weight of each should be more powerful. We thus analyzed the clinical, genetic, and microRNA profiling data of 138 de novo AML patients of our institute. By multivariate analysis we identified high expression of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p were independent poor prognostic factors, while that of hsa-miR-203 had a trend to be a favorable factor. We constructed a scoring system from expression of these 3 microRNAs by considering the weight of each. The scores correlated with distinct clinical and biological features and outperformed single microRNA expression in prognostication. In both ours and another validation cohort, higher scores were associated with shorter overall survival, independent of other well-known prognostic factors. By analyzing the mRNA expression profiles, we sorted out several cancer-related pathways highly correlated with the microRNA prognostic signature. We conclude this 3-microRNA scoring system is simple and powerful for risk stratification of de novo AML patients.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 27 November 2014. doi:10.1038/leu.2014.333.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Leukemia","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acute Disease","uri":{"id":"D000208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia, Myeloid","uri":{"id":"D007951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute","uri":{"id":"D015470","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Systems Integration","uri":{"id":"D018511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Academies and Institutes","uri":{"id":"D000047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leadership","uri":{"id":"D007857","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia","uri":{"id":"D007938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"MicroRNAs","uri":{"id":"D035683","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428263","title":"A 3-microRNA scoring system for prognostication in de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients.","year":"2014"}

We report results of a time-dependent multivariable analysis of alloHSCT (n=337) versus chemotherapy (n=271) or autologous HSCT (n=152) in 760 patients aged 40 and 60 years with AML in CR1. Patients receiving alloHSCT showed improved survival (OS) as compared to chemotherapy (respectively 57±3% vs 40±3% at 5 years, P<0.001). Comparable OS was observed following alloHSCT and autoHSCT in patients with intermediate risk AML (60±4% vs 54±5%). However, alloHSCT was associated with less relapse (HR 0.51, P<0.001) and better RFS (HR 0.74, P=0.029) as compared to autoHSCT in intermediate risk AMLs. AlloHSCT was applied following myeloablative conditioning (n=157) or reduced intensity conditioning (n=180), resulting in less NRM, but comparable outcome with respect to OS, RFS, and relapse. Collectively, these results show that alloHSCT is to be preferred over chemotherapy as PRT in patients with intermediate and poor risk AML aged 40-60 years, while autoHSCT remains a treatment option to be considered in patients with intermediate risk AML.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 27 November 2014. doi:10.1038/leu.2014.332.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Leukemia","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia, Myeloid","uri":{"id":"D007951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute","uri":{"id":"D015470","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia","uri":{"id":"D007938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Conditioning (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D003213","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428261","title":"Comparative therapeutic value of post remission approaches in patients with acute myeloid leukemia aged 40-60 years.","year":"2014"}

We have also used single cell analysis to study cases with co-existent translocations and hyperdiploidy, to determine how these lesions co-segregate within the clonal substructure, and demonstrated that hyperdiploidy may precede IGH translocation in a proportion of patients.

Posterior fossa lesions are an independent predictor of death in CVT. We aim to describe the characteristics and outcome of patients with CVT and isolated posterior fossa lesions and assess the safety of anticoagulation in patients with posterior fossa lesions associated with CVT. Methods: We retrieved data from all patients with posterior fossa parenchymal lesions in the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) cohort related to clinical features, therapy and outcome. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate associations. To assess the safety of anticoagulation in CVT patients with posterior fossa lesions we considered all patients with a lesion in this topography, either isolated or with concomitant supratentorial lesions, and compared the rate of new intracranial haemorrhages on repeated imaging with the remaining cohort. Results: Out of 624 patients, 12 had isolated posterior fossa lesions and 14 had posterior fossa lesion with accompanying supratentorial lesions. The lateral sinus was most frequently occluded (n = 11). Involvement of the superior sagittal sinus was significantly less frequent compared to the remaining patients of the cohort (p = 0.013). None of the patients with isolated posterior fossa lesion died but 3 remained dependent on follow-up. Poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≥3) was more frequent in patients with any posterior fossa lesion, even when on anticoagulation (29.2% vs. 11.9%; OR 3.04; 95% CI 1.2-7.6; p = 0.018). Of the 24 anticoagulated patients with a posterior fossa lesion, 3 (12.5%) had new haemorrhages on repeated imaging, compared with 30 out of 495 anticoagulated patients (6.1%) without posterior fossa lesions (p = 0.19). Conclusions: We describe the largest series of CVT patients with associated posterior fossa lesions. When compared to anticoagulated CVT patients without posterior fossa lesions, CVT patients with posterior fossa lesions on full anticoagulation did not have a significant increase in the rate of new intracranial haemorrhages. © 2014 S.

Participants on psychotropic medication were excluded from all analyses of executive performance.ResultsPreviously depressed participants, the majority of which had experienced recurrent episodes, matched control participants on both neutral and emotional executive tasks. However, significantly more rumination and expressive suppression, and less cognitive reappraisal, were found in the previously depressed group. Executive function was unrelated to rumination and emotion regulation in this sample.ConclusionsPreviously depressed women whose executive function was intact were characterized by ruminative tendencies and more frequent use of expressive suppression. Trait rumination and expressive suppression are known to increase depression risk, but were unrelated to executive functions in this population. This indicates that unhealthy emotion regulation strategies may be targeted directly in preventive interventions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC psychiatry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Regression Analysis","uri":{"id":"D012044","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Executive Function","uri":{"id":"D056344","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depressive Disorder","uri":{"id":"D003866","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linear Models","uri":{"id":"D016014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emotions","uri":{"id":"D004644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427967","title":"More rumination and less effective emotion regulation in previously depressed women with preserved executive functions.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Upregulator of cell proliferation 4 (URG4) has been implicated in the oncogenesis of certain cancers. However, the correlation between URG4 expression and clinicopathological significance in human cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated its expression and clinicopathological significance in cervical cancer patients. METHODS: URG4 expression was examined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting in normal cervical epithelial cells, cervical cancer cells, and eight matched pairs of cervical cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from the same patient. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine URG4 expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 167 cervical cancer patients (FIGO stages Ib1-IIa2). Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations between URG4 expression and prognostic and diagnostic factors. RESULTS: URG4 was significantly upregulated in the cervical cancer cell lines and tissues compared with the normal cells and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues. IHC revealed high URG4 expression in 59 out of the 167 (35.13%) cervical cancer specimens. Its expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.0001), tumour size (P = 0.012), T classification (P = 0.023), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) and vaginal involvement (P = 0.002). Patients with high URG4 expression, particularly those who received concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P < 0.0001), showed a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with the low expression of this protein. Multivariate analysis revealed that URG4 expression is an independent prognostic factor for cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that elevated URG4 protein expression is associated with a poor outcome in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. URG4 may be a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC cancer","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epithelial Cells","uri":{"id":"D004847","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph Nodes","uri":{"id":"D008198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease-Free Survival","uri":{"id":"D018572","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D002583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph","uri":{"id":"D008196","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011878","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogenesis","uri":{"id":"D063646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaginitis","uri":{"id":"D014627","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427922","title":"URG4 overexpression is correlated with cervical cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer are two very significant contributors to cancer-related deaths. Chronic alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for these cancers. Ethanol is oxidized primarily by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, an agent capable of initiating tumors by forming adducts with proteins and DNA. Acetaldehyde is metabolized by ALDH2, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1A1 to acetate. Retinoic acid (RA) is required for cellular differentiation and is known to arrest tumor development. RA is synthesized from retinaldehyde by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, specifically ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, and ALDH8A1. By eliminating acetaldehyde and generating RA, ALDHs can play a crucial regulatory role in the initiation and progression of cancers. ALDH1 catalytic activity has been used as a biomarker to identify and isolate normal and cancer stem cells; its presence in a tumor is associated with poor prognosis in colon and pancreatic cancer. In summary, these ALDHs are not only biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic cancer but also play important mechanistic role in cancer initiation, progression, and eventual prognosis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alcohol Dehydrogenase","uri":{"id":"D000426","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D013234","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tretinoin","uri":{"id":"D014212","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alcohol Drinking","uri":{"id":"D000428","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogens","uri":{"id":"D002273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplastic Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D014411","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetals","uri":{"id":"D000080","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetates","uri":{"id":"D000085","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxides","uri":{"id":"D010087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidoreductases","uri":{"id":"D010088","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatitis","uri":{"id":"D010195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retinaldehyde","uri":{"id":"D012172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetaldehyde","uri":{"id":"D000079","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ethanol","uri":{"id":"D000431","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427913","title":"Acetaldehyde and retinaldehyde-metabolizing enzymes in colon and pancreatic cancers.","year":"2015"}

Endoscopic screening of 6,014 Japanese alcoholics yielded high detection rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 4.1 %) and head and neck SCC (1.0 %). The risks of upper aerodigestive tract SCC/dysplasia, especially of multiple SCC/dysplasia, were increased in a multiplicative fashion by the presence of a combination of slow-metabolizing ADH1B*1/*1 and inactive heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2 because of prolonged exposure to higher concentrations of ethanol/acetaldehyde. A questionnaire asking about current and past facial flushing after drinking a glass (≈ 180 mL) of beer is a reliable tool for detecting the presence of inactive ALDH2. We invented a health-risk appraisal (HRA) model including the flushing questionnaire and drinking, smoking, and dietary habits. Esophageal SCC was detected at a high rate by endoscopic mass-screening in high HRA score persons. A total of 5.0 % of 4,879 alcoholics had a history of (4.0 %) or newly diagnosed (1.0 %) gastric cancer. Their high frequency of a history of gastric cancer is partly explained by gastrectomy being a risk factor for alcoholism because of altered ethanol metabolism, e.g., by blood ethanol level overshooting. The combination of H. pylori-associated atrophic gastritis and ALDH2*1/*2 showed the greatest risk of gastric cancer in alcoholics. High detection rates of advanced colorectal adenoma/carcinoma were found in alcoholics, 15.7 % of 744 immunochemical fecal occult blood test (IFOBT)-negative alcoholics and 31.5 % of the 393 IFOBT-positive alcoholics. Macrocytosis with an MCV ≥ 106 fl increased the risk of neoplasia in the entire aerodigestive tract of alcoholics, suggesting that poor nutrition as well as ethanol/acetaldehyde exposure plays an important role in neoplasia.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and

However, the mechanism is not fully known. This study examines alcohol metabolism in Streptococcus and its interaction with HPV-16 in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. The acetaldehyde-producing strain Streptococcus gordonii V2016 was analyzed for adh genes and activities of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Streptococcus attachment to immortalized HPV-16 infected human oral keratinocytes, HOK (HPV/HOK-16B), human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes was studied. Acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde, DNA damage, and abnormal proliferation among keratinocytes were also quantified. We found that S. gordonii V2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, AdhA, AdhB, and AdhE, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and ethanol, respectively. S. gordonii V2016 did not show a detectable aldehyde dehydrogenase. AdhE is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in S. gordonii. Acetaldehyde and malondialdehyde production from permissible Streptococcus species significantly increased the bacterial attachment to keratinocytes, which was associated with an enhanced expression of furin to facilitate HPV infection and several malignant phenotypes including acetaldehyde adduct formation, abnormal proliferation, and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by HPV-infected oral keratinocytes. Therefore, expression of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases with no functional aldehyde dehydrogenase contributes to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by oral streptococci. Oral Streptococcus species and HPV may cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after ethanol exposure. These results suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and

It begins with the early planning phase of building a society and includes considerations of how that society will grow. Therefore, history, culture, religion, and socioeconomy are important components to include in any relevant and integrated studies of wastewater management and reuse. Engineering, health, chemistry, biology, food production, cultural heritage, and the needs of people of all ages should be considered together when making management decisions regarding issues so intimately tied with humanity as water and sanitation. Other escalating challenges such as poverty, food, and water scarcity, migration and instability, flooding and catastrophes, diseases and mortality, etc. should also be considered as part of wastewater management and reuse planning. Emerging contaminants could be associated with the urbanization, modernization, and industrialization of several countries. Several arid countries have developed water security strategies where wastewater reuse is a major component. The existing wastewater treatment technologies in these countries are, in most cases, unable to remove such contaminants which may affect irrigation waters, industrial products, groundwater, etc. People would have to accept that the food on their tables could be irrigated with treated wastewater that they generated a few months ago, even if very advanced technologies were used to treat it. The purpose of this review is to highlight multidisciplinary areas of research on wastewater and to propose applicable and affordable mechanisms by which we may consider wastewater as a legitimate resource.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developing Countries","uri":{"id":"D003906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developed Countries","uri":{"id":"D019049","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Floods","uri":{"id":"D055868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Middle East","uri":{"id":"D008877","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biology","uri":{"id":"D001695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemistry","uri":{"id":"D002621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emigration and Immigration","uri":{"id":"D004641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Industry","uri":{"id":"D007221","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urbanization","uri":{"id":"D014507","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Groundwater","uri":{"id":"D060587","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Waste Water","uri":{"id":"D062065","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poverty","uri":{"id":"D011203","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Religion","uri":{"id":"D012067","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sanitation","uri":{"id":"D012499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Change","uri":{"id":"D012922","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Catastrophization","uri":{"id":"D058443","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427896","title":"Ten key research issues for integrated and sustainable wastewater reuse in the Middle East.","year":"2014"}

To evaluate whether age and gender have been found to be reliable predictors of the PR across medical subspecialties, we extracted 75 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions performed in major medical areas (neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine) known for high PR rates. The literature database used contains approximately 2,500 papers on various aspects of the genuine PR. These 'meta-analyses' were screened for statistical predictors of the PR across multiple RCT, including age and gender, but also other patient-based and design-based predictors of higher PR rates. Retrieved papers were sorted for areas and disease categories. Only 15 of the 75 analyses noted an effect of younger age to be associated with higher PR, and this was predominantly in psychiatric conditions but not in depression, and internal medicine but not in gastroenterology. Female gender was associated with higher PR in only 3 analyses. Among the patient-based predictors, the most frequently noted factor was lower symptom severity at baseline, and among the design-based factors, it was a randomization ratio that selected more patients to drugs than to placebo, more frequent study visits, and more recent trials that were associated with higher PR rates. While younger age may contribute to the PR in some conditions, sex does not. There is currently no evidence that the PR is different in the elderly. PR are, however, markedly influenced by the symptom severity at baseline, and by the likelihood of receiving active treatment in placebo-controlled trials. © 2014 S.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: There is scarce information available on oral health service utilization patterns and common oral hygiene practices among adult Nigerians. We conducted the 2010-2011 national oral health survey before the introduction of the national oral health policy to determine the prevalence of oral health service utilization, patterns of oral hygiene practices, and self reported oral health status, among adults in various social classes, educational strata, ethnic groups and geopolitical zones in Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in North-Central, North-West, South-East, South-South and South-West geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Multi-stage cluster sampling method was used for the sample selection. We administered a structured questionnaire to a total of 7,630 participants. Information on the socio-demographic characteristics, oral hygiene practices and oral health services utilization pattern of participants was obtained. RESULTS: We interviewed 7, 630 participants (55.6% female). The participants ages ranged between 18 and 81 years, mean age was 37.96 (SD = 13.2). Overall 21.2% of the participants rated their oral health status as very good, 37.1% as good and 27.4% as fair. Only 26.4% reported having visited the dentist at least once prior to the conduct of the survey. More than half of these visits (54.9%) were for treatment purpose. Utilization of oral health services was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with being older, more educated and being engaged in a skilled profession. More educated persons, females and younger persons used toothbrushes for daily tooth cleaning. Age, sex, marital status, level of education and occupation were significantly related to daily frequency of tooth cleaning (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results show that while most Nigerian adults have a positive view of their oral health status, majority reported poor oral health utilization habits. Older persons resident in the northern zones of the country and less educated persons displayed poorer oral hygiene practices. The study findings suggest that there is low oral health service utilization among adult Nigerians and that socio-demographic variables influence oral health utilization habits and oral hygiene behavior among adult Nigerians Further studies to identify other factors influencing oral health behavior are suggested.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC oral

Molecular data on these tumors have a major impact on prognosis and therapy of the patients. Consequently, the inclusion of molecular parameters in the WHO definition of brain tumors is being planned and has been forwarded as the \"ISN-Haarlem\" consensus. We, here, analyze markers of special interest including ATRX, IDH and 1p/19q codeletion in a series of 405 adult patients. Among the WHO 2007 classified tumors were 152 astrocytomas, 61 oligodendrogliomas, 63 oligoastrocytomas and 129 glioblastomas. Following the concepts of the \"ISN-Haarlem\", we rediagnosed the series to obtain \"integrated\" diagnoses with 155 tumors being astrocytomas, 100 oligodendrogliomas and 150 glioblastomas. In a subset of 100 diffuse gliomas from the NOA-04 trial with long-term follow-up data available, the \"integrated\" diagnosis had a significantly greater prognostic power for overall and progression-free survival compared to WHO 2007. Based on the \"integrated\" diagnoses, loss of ATRX expression was close to being mutually exclusive to 1p/19q codeletion, with only 2 of 167 ATRX-negative tumors exhibiting 1p/19q codeletion. All but 4 of 141 patients with loss of ATRX expression and diffuse glioma carried either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Interestingly, the majority of glioblastoma patients with loss of ATRX expression but no IDH mutations exhibited an H3F3A mutation. Further, all patients with 1p/19 codeletion carried a mutation in IDH1 or IDH2. We present an algorithm based on stepwise analysis with initial immunohistochemistry for ATRX and IDH1-R132H followed by 1p/19q analysis followed by IDH sequencing which reduces the number of molecular analyses and which has a far better association with patient outcome than WHO 2007.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Acta neuropathologica","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oligodendroglioma","uri":{"id":"D009837","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease-Free Survival","uri":{"id":"D018572","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioblastoma","uri":{"id":"D005909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glioma","uri":{"id":"D005910","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oligodendroglioma","uri":{"id":"D009837","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Specialization","uri":{"id":"D013038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Symbiosis","uri":{"id":"D013559","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"World Health Organization","uri":{"id":"D014944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Astrocytoma","uri":{"id":"D001254","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427834","title":"ATRX and IDH1-R132H immunohistochemistry with subsequent copy number analysis and IDH sequencing as a basis for an \"integrated\" diagnostic approach for adult astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Up to half of all new HIV cases in Los Angeles may be caused by the 20-30% of men who have sex with men (MSM) with unrecognized HIV infection. Racial/ethnic minority MSM are at particularly high risk for being sero-unaware and due to stigma and poor healthcare access might benefit from novel private, self-testing methods, such as the recently FDA-approved OraQuick(R) In-Home HIV Test. METHODS: From July-November 2013, we undertook a pilot study to examine the feasibility of a voucher program for free OraQuick(R) tests targeting African American MSM in Los Angeles. We determined feasibility based on: (1) the establishment of a voucher redemption and third-party payment system, (2) the willingness of community-based organizations (CBOs) to disseminate vouchers, and (3) the collection of user demographics, test and linkage-to-care results with an anonymous telephone survey. RESULTS: We partnered with Walgreens(R) to create a voucher and third-party reimbursement system for free OraQuick(R) tests. Voucher distribution was divided into two periods. In total, 641 vouchers were supplied to CBOs: 274 (42.7%) went to clients and of those 53 (19.3%) were redeemed. Fifty (18.2%) of the 274 clients were surveyed: 44 (88%) were African American, 39 (78%) reported being likely to repeat voucher use, 44 (88%) reported reviewing pre-test information, and 37 (74%) the post-test information. Three (6%) of 50 survey respondents reported newly testing HIV-positive of whom all (100%) reported seeking medical care. Two withheld their results, both of whom also sought medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Developing and partnering with a commercial pharmacy to institute a voucher system to facilitate HIV self-testing with linkage-to-care was feasible. Our findings suggest the voucher program was associated with increasing the identification of new cases of HIV infection with high rates of linkage to care. Expanded research and evaluation of voucher programs for HIV self-test kits among high-risk groups is warranted.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC public health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pilot Projects","uri":{"id":"D010865","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV Infections","uri":{"id":"D015658","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Americans","uri":{"id":"D001741","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Health, Reimbursement","uri":{"id":"D007349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Academies and Institutes","uri":{"id":"D000047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anonyms and Pseudonyms","uri":{"id":"D000851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Awareness","uri":{"id":"D001364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV","uri":{"id":"D006678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Autonomy","uri":{"id":"D026684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Minors","uri":{"id":"D033242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacies","uri":{"id":"D010594","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacy","uri":{"id":"D010604","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Telephone","uri":{"id":"D013689","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Los Angeles","uri":{"id":"D015141","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427749","title":"Piloting an HIV self-test kit voucher program to raise serostatus awareness of high-risk African Americans, Los Angeles.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an extremely poor prognosis although sorafenib, which is the treatment of choice, has provided survival benefits. Among advanced diseases, liver-confined HCC, which invades the vasculature without extrahepatic metastasis, requires novel therapeutic management beyond using sorafenib alone. Currently, the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend combined radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy for some selected cases. For advanced liver-confined HCC, focal liver irradiation, RT technological development, and optimal selection of RT-suitable patients enable clinicians to use RT-involving multimodality treatments based on oncologic principles, such as concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which represent effective multimodality treatments for several types of malignancy. SUMMARY: In this review, we discuss the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches for liver-confined HCC and clinical applications of RT-involving multimodality treatments for advanced liver-confined HCC. CONCLUSION: RT-involving multimodality treatments can enhance the overall therapeutic successes for advanced liver-confined HCC and also provide potential cures to some patients via conversion to a resectable condition. © 2014 S.

Thus, we assessed whether the use of antidepressants (ADs) is associated with an increased risk of chronic AF (cAF). Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a nested case-control analysis was conducted within a cohort of new AD users having a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Cases of cAF occurring during follow-up were individually matched with up to 10 controls on age, sex, year of cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cAF associated with current and recent use of ADs, when compared to past use. The cohort included 116,125 new AD users, of whom 1271 were diagnosed with cAF during follow-up (incidence rate: 1.6 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted RR of cAF associated with current and recent use of ADs was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.86-1.12) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.86-1.30), respectively. No association was observed when ADs were classified according to their potency in reducing serotonin reuptake.

The objective of this study was to compare multiple measures of adherence and investigate factors associated with adherence among HIV-infected children in western Kenya. METHODS: We evaluated ART adherence prospectively for six months among HIV-infected children aged ≤14 years attending a large outpatient HIV clinic in Kenya. Adherence was reported using caregiver report, plasma drug concentrations and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS®). Kappa statistics were used to compare adherence estimates with MEMS®. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between child, caregiver and household characteristics with dichotomized adherence (MEMS® adherence ≥90% vs. <90%) and MEMS® treatment interruptions of ≥48 hours. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 191 children, mean age at baseline was 8.2 years and 55% were female. Median adherence by MEMS® was 96.3% and improved over the course of follow-up (p<0.01), although 49.5% of children had at least one MEMS® treatment interruption of ≥48 hours. Adherence estimates were highest by caregiver report, and there was poor agreement between MEMS® and other adherence measures (Kappa statistics 0.04-0.37). In multivariable logistic regression, only caregiver-reported missed doses in the past 30 days (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.39), late doses in the past seven days (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.22) and caregiver-reported problems with getting the child to take ART (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20) were significantly associated with dichotomized MEMS® adherence. The caregivers reporting that ART made the child sick (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25) and reporting difficulties in the community that made giving ART more difficult (e.g. stigma) (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.27) were significantly associated with MEMS® treatment interruptions in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence in the form of missed and late doses, treatment interruptions of more than 48 hours and sub-therapeutic drug levels were common in this cohort. Adherence varied significantly by adherence measure, suggesting that additional validation of adherence measures is needed. Few factors were consistently associated with non-adherence or treatment interruptions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the International AIDS Society","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ambulatory Care Facilities","uri":{"id":"D000554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Regression Analysis","uri":{"id":"D012044","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Odds Ratio","uri":{"id":"D016017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Family Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D005191","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV","uri":{"id":"D006678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kenya","uri":{"id":"D007630","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outpatients","uri":{"id":"D010045","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caregivers","uri":{"id":"D017028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427633","title":"Measuring adherence to antiretroviral therapy in children and adolescents in western Kenya.","year":"2014"}

Oncolytic virotherapy with engineered herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a promising therapy for glioblastoma; however, the efficacy of γ134.5-deleted HSVs, which have been used in clinical trials, was diminished in hypoxia. We investigated the ability of a chimeric human cytolomegalovirus (HCMV)/HSV-1 virus, which expresses the human CMV protein kinase R evasion gene IRS1 and is in preparation for clinical trials, to infect and kill adult and pediatric patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts in hypoxia and normoxia. Infectivity, cytotoxicity and viral recovery were significantly greater with the chimeric virus compared with the γ134.5-deleted virus, regardless of oxygen tension. The chimeric virus infected and killed CD133+ GSCs similarly to wild-type HSV-1. Increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and its substrate heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) was seen after viral infection in normoxia compared with hypoxia. Hsp27 knockdown or p38 inhibition reduced virus recovery, indicating that the p38 pathway has a role in the reduced efficacy of the γ134.5-deleted virus in hypoxia. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that chimeric HCMV/HSV-1 efficiently targets both CD133+ GSCs and glioma cells in hypoxia.Gene Therapy advance online publication, 27 November 2014;

The role of some IGFBPs in malignant CNS tumours, except glioblastoma, is unknown. We evaluated the protein expression of 3 IGFBP isoforms (IGFBP-2, -3, -5) in medulloblastoma and correlated them with histological subtypes and clinical parameters. Methods: The expression of IGFBP-2, -3 and -5 was analysed in 67 samples of medulloblastoma by immunohistochemistry and correlated with histological subtypes and patient prognosis. Results: IGFBP-3 expression was seen in 37.3% of cases and IGFBP-5 expression in 80.6% of cases. IGFBP-2 expression was totally absent in medulloblastoma. The extent of IGFBP-3 expression was higher in anaplastic when compared to classical and desmoplastic subtypes (p < 0.05). IGFBP-5 expression was significantly higher in classical and anaplastic subtypes when compared to desmoplastic medulloblastoma (p < 0.05). No influence of IGFBPs on survival was noted. Conclusions: This is the first study to report expression of 3 cancer-related biomarkers - IGFBP-2, -3, -5 in medulloblastoma. Significantly higher extents of expression of IGFBP-3 in large cell variant and IGFBP-5 in classical and anaplastic subtypes suggest a plausible role of these molecules in specific molecular pathways of medulloblastoma. © 2014 S.

METHODS: Data were from the 2008-2010 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, a representative sample of Wisconsin adults aged 21-74 years. Participants completed questionnaires about their caregiving, sociodemographics, and HRQoL; 264 caregivers were identified. Staged generalized additive models assessed the associations among caregiving characteristics, caregiver strain, and HRQoL; survey weights were applied to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: More hours per week of care and greater duration of caregiving were associated with higher levels of strain. Greater caregiver strain was in turn associated with worse mental HRQoL. However, most caregiving characteristics were not directly associated with mental or physical HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a chains-of-risk model in which caregiving may increase strain, which may in turn adversely influence mental HRQoL. Using this perspective to refine interventions may improve our ability to support caregivers on practice and policy levels.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality of Life","uri":{"id":"D011788","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caregivers","uri":{"id":"D017028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caregivers","uri":{"id":"D017028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wisconsin","uri":{"id":"D014922","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427430","title":"The relationship among caregiving characteristics, caregiver strain, and health-related quality of life: evidence from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin.","year":"2014"}

Of the 1,582 patients, 265 had a poor treatment outcome. Of the 265 patients with a poor treatment outcome, 216 had defaulted on treatment, 7 failed treatment, 9 died and 33 transferred to another area. After adjusting for sex, age and BCG status, failure acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive sputum to convert to AFB negative by 2-3 months was the only risk factor significantly associated with a poor treatment outcome (odds ratio 7.57; 95% CI: 1.22-47.1).

To our knowledge, there has not been a comparative study focusing on cytological nuclear features of pulmonary adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS mutation (KRAS-AD). Hence, we compared the cytomorphology of metastatic KRAS-AD and EGFR-positive adenocarcinoma (EGFR-AD) in aspiration specimens from lymph nodes. METHODS: Forty lymph node aspiration specimens from forty KRAS-AD patients were collected at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) from 2009 to 2013. As a control group, 40 EBUS-FNA lymph node specimens from 20 EGFR-AD patients were collected. EGFR-AD specimens were evaluated at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) from 2012 to 2013. All 80 specimens were histologically confirmed to metastatic adenocarcinoma. Two pathologists performed a blinded review of all specimens. RESULTS: Compared with EGFR-AD, KRAS-AD exhibited more severe nuclear pleomorphism (P < 0.001), coarse chromatin (P = 0.001), cherry-red nucleoli (P < 0.001) and naked tumor cells (P = 0.002) with necrotic (P < 0.001) and neutrophilic (P = 0.008) background.
