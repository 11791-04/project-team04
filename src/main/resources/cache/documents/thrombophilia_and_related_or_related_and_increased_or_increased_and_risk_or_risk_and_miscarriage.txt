Exercise (planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength, gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists and consulted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that recruited community-dwelling people (where the majority were aged 65 and over) and were not restricted to specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke, hip fracture). We included trials that evaluated exercise interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise interventions were varied; for example, they could be 'prescriptions' or recommendations, group-based or individual, supervised or unsupervised. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. We combined effect sizes across studies using the fixed-effect model, with the random-effect model used where significant statistical heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where different measures or different formats of the same measure were used. Where possible, we performed various, usually prespecified, sensitivity and subgroup analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling.Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes.Exercise interventions were associated with a small to moderate reduction in fear of falling immediately post intervention (SMD 0.37 favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24 favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However, there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control.There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants).Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies that reported fear of falling. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions in community-dwelling older people probably reduce fear of falling to a limited extent immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed randomised trials is required, priority should be given to establishing a core set of outcomes that includes fear of falling for all trials examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic

This study aimed to discover novel herbal extract(s) for the treatment of osteoporosis. We screened 64 ethanol extracts of edible plants native to Korea for their ability to increase the cellular proliferation and differentiation of two osteoblastic cell lines: C3H10T1/2 and MC3T3-E1. We selected a Lycii Radicis Cortex (LRC), Lycium Chinese root bark as the primary candidate. Treatment with LRC extract showed enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and increased expression of bone metabolic markers Alpl, Runx2, and Bglap genes in both osteoblastic cell lines. There was no effect on the osteoclastic differentiation of primary-cultured monocytes from the mouse bone marrows. Furthermore, the study examined the effect of LRC extract in vivo in ovariectomizd (OVX) mice for 8 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was significantly higher in LRC extract-administered group than in the non-LRC-administered OVX control group. The results indicated that LRC extract prevented the OVX-induced BMD loss in mice via promoting the differentiation of osteoblast linage cells. These results suggest that LRC extract may be a good natural herbal medicine candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecules (Basel,

Therefore it is more frequent than in the past that the Approved Physician (\"Autorizzato\" according to Italian legislation) have to judge working fitness in employees suffering from cancer and at the same time exposed to ionizing sources. Aims: In this study we give suggestions for the decision if a worker, who have previously suffered from malignant tumors, is ready to go or not to go back to work. Methods: Though we believe in the preventive theory of the linear correlation without threshold for stochastic effects (\"Linear No Threshold\" LNT), we considered data from the literature that highlight how very low doses of radiation exposure do not increase the risk of stochastic effects and how the potential occupational exposure to low doses does not introduce a significant additional risk of cancer in subjects with a history of malignant tumor. Results: We identify \"objective\" elements of judgment related to the neoplastic disease of the worker and his activity, but we emphasize the importance of the psychological condition of the worker, as well as his professional interest and his career opportunities. Conclusions: The criteria we recommend were applied to a group of workers suffering from cancer and with different working activities at risk of exposure to ionizing radiations. The evaluation process is a first rational approach to the assessment of their suitability in worker suffering from neoplastic disease, with the need for custom handling for each individual.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"La Medicina del lavoro","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation, Ionizing","uri":{"id":"D011839","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occupational Exposure","uri":{"id":"D016273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Return to Work","uri":{"id":"D062707","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Judgment","uri":{"id":"D007600","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occupations","uri":{"id":"D009790","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Psychological","uri":{"id":"D013315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suggestion","uri":{"id":"D013404","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431983","title":"","year":"2014"}

Here, we aimed to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the untranslated regions of the EGLN1 and HIF-1AN genes and SNPs chosen from a genome-wide adaptation study of the Han Chinese population. To assess the association between EGLN1 and HIF-1AN SNPs and AMS in a Han Chinese population, a case-control study was performed including 190 patients and 190 controls. In total, thirteen SNPs were genotyped using the MassARRAY® MALDI-TOF system. Multiple genetic models were tested; The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values indicated that the dominant model may serve as the best-fit model for rs12406290 and rs2153364 of significant difference. However, these data were not significant after Bonferroni correction. No significant association was noted between AMS and rs12757362, rs1339894, rs1361384, rs2009873, rs2739513 or rs2486729 before and after Bonferroni correction. Further haplotype analyses indicated the presence of two blocks in EGLN1; one block consists of rs12406290-rs2153364, located upstream of the EGLN1 gene.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Background: Cases of children with more than one type of cancer either diagnosed simultaneously or successively, rarely occur in pediatric oncology. A second malignant neoplasm may be caused by mutagenic effects of the treatment of the primary malignancy and/or may point towards an underlying genetic cancer susceptibility syndrome. One example of such a syndrome is constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency, (CMMR-D) which carries an increased risk of various tumors including childhood hematologic malignancies and Lynch syndrome associated tumors. Timely diagnosis of CMMR-D is crucial, since this diagnosis has implications for the entire family. Patient: We report the case of a 15-year-old girl who was born to consanguineous parents. At the age of 20 months she was diagnosed with a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment was given according to NHL-BFM 95. 12 years later, an invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon was surgically removed which relapsed shortly afterwards. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was employed to rapidly detect the underlying mutation in this suspected CMMR-D patient. Results: After a short turnaround time of less than 3 weeks, the diagnosis of CMMR-D could be confirmed by the identification of a homozygous 29-bp deletion in MSH6 (exon 6), which was confirmed by independent methods. Conclusions: We demonstrate that \"bed-side\" whole-exome sequencing is both feasible and cost-effective and may be the method of choice to rapidly uncover the genetical basis of (inherited) diseases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Klinische Padiatrie","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma, T-Cell","uri":{"id":"D016399","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms, Second Primary","uri":{"id":"D016609","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Predisposition to Disease","uri":{"id":"D020022","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis","uri":{"id":"D003123","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin","uri":{"id":"D008228","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hematologic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D019337","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenocarcinoma","uri":{"id":"D000230","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consanguinity","uri":{"id":"D003241","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Constitution and Bylaws","uri":{"id":"D003249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exons","uri":{"id":"D005091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D008223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parents","uri":{"id":"D010290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D013577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wills","uri":{"id":"D014918","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutagens","uri":{"id":"D009153","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431869","title":"Constitutional Mismatch Repair-deficiency and Whole-exome Sequencing as the Means of the Rapid Detection of the Causative MSH6 Defect.","year":"2014"}

Patient and Methods: We evaluated the prognosis of iAMP21 among patients from the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) 2000 trial with 46 of 2 637 (2%) patients iAMP21+. Results: 8-year event-free-survival (EFS, 64±8% vs. 81±1%, p=0.0026) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 29±8% vs. 14±1%, p=0.008) of the iAMP21 cases were significantly worse compared with non-iAMP21 patients. Within the MRD low-risk group, iAMP21 cases (n=14) had an inferior 8-year EFS (76±12% vs. 92±1%, p=0.0081), but no increased CIR (10±10% vs. 6±1%, p=0.624). Within the MRD intermediate-risk group, iAMP21 cases (n=27) had a worse 8-year EFS (56±11% vs. 78±2%, p=0.0077) and CIR (44±11% vs. 20±2%, p=0.003) with 6/10 relapses occurring after 2 years. Conclusions: Conclusively, we believe that there is no necessity for enrolling all iAMP21 patients into the high-risk arm of ongoing ALL-BFM trials because MRD low-risk patients have a moderate relapse risk under current therapy. Whether the increased relapse risk in MRD intermediate-risk patients can be avoided by late treatment intensification remains to be answered by the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial randomly using protracted pegylated L-asparaginase during delayed intensification and early maintenance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Klinische Padiatrie","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21","uri":{"id":"D002891","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D054198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leukemia","uri":{"id":"D007938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maintenance","uri":{"id":"D008283","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431866","title":"Minimal Residual Disease-based Treatment is Adequate for Relapse-prone Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with an intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21: The experience of the ALL-BFM 2000 trial.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: Cohort study of preterm low birth weight infants followed until 24 months CA, in a university hospital between January 2009 and December 2010. Inclusion criteria: gestational age<37 weeks and birth weight of 1,500-2,499g. Exclusion criteria: multiple pregnancies, major congenital anomalies, and loss to follow up in the 2(nd) year of life. The following were evaluated: weight, length, and BMI. Outcomes: growth failure and risk of overweight at 0, 12, and 24 months CA. Student's t-test, Repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA), and multiple logistic regression were used. RESULTS: A total of 80 preterm low birth weight infants born to hypertensive mothers and 101 born to normotensive mothers were studied. There was a higher risk of overweight in children of hypertensive mothers at 24 months; however, maternal hypertension was not a risk factor for inadequate growth. Logistic regression showed that being born small for gestational age and inadequate growth in the first 12 months of life were associated with poorer growth at 24 months.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Epidemiological studies of humans and experimental studies with mouse models suggest that sunburn resulting from exposure to excessive UV light and damage to DNA confers an increased risk for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Previous reports have shown that both nucleotide excision repair, which is the sole pathway in humans for removing UV photoproducts, and DNA replication, are regulated by the circadian clock in mouse skin. Furthermore, the timing of UV exposure during the circadian cycle has been shown to affect skin carcinogenesis in mice. Because sunburn and skin cancer are causally related, we investigated UV-induced sunburn apoptosis and erythema in mouse skin as a function of circadian time. Interestingly, we observed that sunburn apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine induction, and erythema were maximal following an acute early morning exposure to UV and minimal following an afternoon exposure. Early morning exposure to UV also produced maximal activation of Atr-mediated DNA damage checkpoint signaling including activation of the tumor suppressor p53, which is known to control the process of sunburn apoptosis. To our knowledge these data provide the first evidence that the circadian clock plays an important role in the erythemal response in UV-irradiated skin. The early morning is when DNA repair is at a minimum, thus the acute responses likely are associated with unrepaired DNA damage. The prior report that mice are more susceptible to skin cancer induction following chronic irradiation in the AM, when p53 levels are maximally induced, is discussed in terms of the mutational inactivation of p53 during chronic irradiation.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 28 November 2014. doi:10.1038/jid.2014.508.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of investigative dermatology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Damage","uri":{"id":"D004249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Experimentation","uri":{"id":"D006805","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Damage","uri":{"id":"D004249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Skin Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D012878","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epidemiologic Studies","uri":{"id":"D016021","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Repair","uri":{"id":"D004260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Replication","uri":{"id":"D004261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ultraviolet Rays","uri":{"id":"D014466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Circadian Clocks","uri":{"id":"D057906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Erythema","uri":{"id":"D004890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Melanoma","uri":{"id":"D008545","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Causality","uri":{"id":"D015984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytokines","uri":{"id":"D016207","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogenesis","uri":{"id":"D063646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dermatology","uri":{"id":"D003880","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sunburn","uri":{"id":"D013471","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431853","title":"The Circadian Clock Controls Sunburn Apoptosis and Erythema in Mouse Skin.","year":"2014"}

Materials and Methods: This prospective study consisted of 148 adolescents (97 girls and 51 boys) between the ages of 14 and 17 who were patients of an orthodontic clinic. OHRQoL was assessed by a modified questionnaire that evaluated four domains: oral symptoms, functional limitations as well as emotional and social well-being in three time frames: before bonding and banding (T0), two months after initiating orthodontic treatment (T1) and six months after initiating orthodontic treatment (T2). The repeated measures test was used to compare the relative changes of OHRQoL among the different time frames. Results: There were no significant differences between the levels of OHRQoL and its domains for boys or girls at any time point. The overall level of OHRQoL decreased significantly at T1 relative to T0; however, the emotional well-being domain improved at T1 in comparison to T0. At T2, the OHRQoL level increased significantly relative to T0 in all domains. Conclusion: The patients' quality-of-life level decreased by initiating orthodontic treatment; however, during that period, emotional well-being increased.

Methods. 276 diabetics elders were screened for MCI and depressive symptoms. Detailed information of history of diabetes, and data of BMI, HbA1c, and blood lipids were collected. Results. The prevalence of MCI was 31.5%, depressive syndrome was 29.7%, and MCI with coexisting depressive mood was 9.1%. The logistic regression analysis revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been diagnosed with MCI were: higher HbA1c level, previous CVD, hypertension, retinopathy, increased number of comorbidities, and less years of formal education. Significant predictors of having a depressive mood included female gender, single marital status, current and past smoking status, lack of physical activity, higher BMI and total cholesterol level, increased number of comorbidities, history of hypoglycemia, and insulin treatment. Factors associated with both MCI and depressive syndrome were female gender, single marital status, past smoking status, retinopathy, previous CVD or stroke, increased number of comorbidities, and insulin treatment.

Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR) is a well-documented adverse effect of penicillin treatment in syphilis. Stroke has not been reported as part of its phenomenology. Case Report. A 57-year-old man presented with worsening memory. His minimental status examination score was 14/30. Serum RPR test was positive and VDRL test in the CSF was reactive. Within six hours of first dose of IV crystalline penicillin G, he was found to have hemineglect and difficulty moving the left leg. MRI of the brain showed multiple acute ischemic strokes. Immediate MRA ruled out vascular occlusion. Penicillin treatment was stopped. Four hours later, he was found to be febrile and had two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Conclusions. We report a case of confirmed neurosyphilis with no known modifiable stroke risk factors, who developed acute ischemic stroke and other constitutional symptoms consistent with JHR after IV penicillin. This is the first reported case in literature where an acute ischemic stroke can be attributed to Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

CHEK2 plays a critical role in DNA replication by responding to double-stranded breaks. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the role of a genetic variant, 1100delC, of CHEK2 on prostate cancer risk and discuss the implication for potential translation of this knowledge into clinical practice. Currently, twelve articles that discussed CHEK2 (∗)1100delC and its association with prostate cancer were identified.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Object. Gender and disease course specific incidences were studied in high- and medium-risk regions of MS in Finland. Methods. Age- and gender-specific incidences with 95% CIs were calculated in 10-year periods from 1981 to 2010. Poser diagnostic criteria were used and compared with the McDonald criteria from 2001 to 2010. Association between age and diagnostic delay over time was assessed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results. 1419 (89%) RRMS and 198 (11%) PPMS cases were included. RRMS incidence increased with the female to male ratio (F/M) from 4,2/10(5) (F/M 1.9) to 9,7 (2.3), while that of PPMS decreased from 1,2 (1.6) to 0,7 (1.2). The use of McDonald criteria did not change the conclusion. The decreasing diagnostic delay and age at diagnosis in RRMS were associated within the 10-year periods and contrasted those in PPMS. Increasing female risk in RRMS was observed in the high-risk region. Conclusion. Increasing RRMS incidence and high female ratios shown in each age group indicate gender-specific influences acting already from childhood. A more precise definition of the risk factors and their action in MS is needed to provide a better understanding of underlying pathological processes and a rationale for the development of new preventive and treatment strategies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Multiple sclerosis international","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age Groups","uri":{"id":"D009273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathologic Processes","uri":{"id":"D010335","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Finland","uri":{"id":"D005387","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431672","title":"Increasing Incidence in Relapsing-Remitting MS and High Rates among Young Women in Finland: A Thirty-Year Follow-Up.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: Preoperative comparative radiation dosimetry was performed to evaluate 319 consecutive uveal melanomas treated between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS: There were 68 (21.3 %) anterior (iris and/or ciliary body) and 251 (78.7 %) choroidal melanomas examined in this study. According to AJCC staging, 7th edition, 146 (45.8 %) were T1, 126 (39.5 %) T2, 40 (12.5 %) T3, and 7 (2.2 %) T4. All were prescribed an equivalent tumor-apex dose. When compared to (125)I, (103)Pd was associated with a mean 41.9 % lower radiation dose to the opposite eye wall (p < 0.001), 12.7 % to the lens center (p < 0.001), 7.5 % to the optic disc (p = 0.008), and a 3.8 % decrease to the fovea (p = 0.034). However, subgroup analysis of smaller (T1-staged) tumors showed greater dose reductions to normal ocular structures compared to larger (T4-staged) tumors. Tumor and therefore plaque location also affected intraocular dose distribution. For example, palladium-103-related dose reductions to the fovea, optic nerve, and opposite eye wall were significantly greater for iris and ciliary body tumors compared to posterior choroidal melanomas (p < 0.001). After comparative dosimetry, 98.7 % (n = 315/319) were treated with (103)Pd. CONCLUSION: Preoperative comparative radiation dosimetry was performed for a large cohort of patients with uveal melanoma. It influenced radionuclide selection, offered an opportunity for radiation sparing of critical vision-related intraocular structures, and typically increased radiation within the tumors.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of radiation oncology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ciliary Body","uri":{"id":"D002924","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Optic Nerve","uri":{"id":"D009900","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiometry","uri":{"id":"D011874","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brachytherapy","uri":{"id":"D001918","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Choroid","uri":{"id":"D002829","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Choroiditis","uri":{"id":"D002833","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Iris","uri":{"id":"D007498","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Melanoma","uri":{"id":"D008545","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radioisotopes","uri":{"id":"D011868","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431638","title":"(103)Pd versus (125)I ophthalmic plaque brachytherapy: preoperative comparative radiation dosimetry for 319 uveal melanomas.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) was launched in 2005. The core prophylactic perioperative antibiotic guidelines were created due to recognition of the impact of proper perioperative prophylaxis on an estimated annual one million inpatient days and $1.6 billion in excess health care costs secondary to preventable surgical site infections (SSIs). An internal study was conducted to create low cost, standardized processes on an institutional level to improve compliance with prophylactic antibiotic administration. METHODS: We assessed the impact of auditing and notifying providers of SCIP errors on overall compliance with inpatient antibiotic guidelines and on net financial gain or loss to a large tertiary center between March 1st 2010 and September 31st 2013. We hypothesized that direct physician-to-physician feedback would result in significant compliance improvements. RESULTS: Through physician notification, our hospital was able to significantly improve SCIP compliance and emphasis on patient safety within a year of intervention implementation. The hospital earned an additional $290,612 in 2011 and $209,096 in 2012 for re-investment in patient care initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Provider education and direct notification of SCIP prophylactic antibiotic dosing errors resulted in improved compliance with national patient improvement guidelines. There were differences between the anesthesiology and surgery department feedback responses, the latter likely attributed to diverse surgical department sub-divisions, frequent changes in resident trainees and supervising attending staff, and the comparative ability. Provider notification of guideline non-compliance should be encouraged as standard practice to improve patient safety. Also, the hospital experienced increased revenue for re-investment in patient care as a secondary result of provider notification.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Patient safety in surgery","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Secondary Care","uri":{"id":"D063127","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Care","uri":{"id":"D005791","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Safety","uri":{"id":"D061214","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antibiotic Prophylaxis","uri":{"id":"D019072","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Bacterial Agents","uri":{"id":"D000900","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compliance","uri":{"id":"D003187","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Feedback","uri":{"id":"D005246","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inpatients","uri":{"id":"D007297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internship and Residency","uri":{"id":"D007396","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anesthesiology","uri":{"id":"D000776","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431623","title":"Description of a multidisciplinary initiative to improve SCIP measures related to pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis compliance: a single-center success story.","year":"2014"}

Current view of the underlying mechanism of tinnitus is that it results from changes in brain activity in various structures of the brain as a consequence of sensory deprivation. This in turn gives rise to increased spontaneous activity and/or synchrony in the auditory centers but also involves modulation from non-auditory processes from structures of the limbic and paralimbic system. Some of the neural changes associated with tinnitus may be assessed non-invasively in human beings with MEG and EEG (M/EEG) in ways, which are superior to animal studies and other non-invasive imaging techniques. However, both MEG and EEG have their limitations and research results can be misinterpreted without appropriate consideration of these limitations. In this article, I intend to provide a brief review of these techniques, describe what the recorded signals reflect in terms of the underlying neural activity, and their strengths and limitations. I also discuss some pertinent methodological issues involved in tinnitus-related studies and conclude with suggestions to minimize possible discrepancies between results. The overall message is that while MEG and EEG are extremely useful techniques, the interpretation of results from tinnitus studies requires much caution given the individual variability in oscillatory activity and the limits of these techniques.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in neurology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensory Deprivation","uri":{"id":"D012683","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electroencephalography","uri":{"id":"D004569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suggestion","uri":{"id":"D013404","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tinnitus","uri":{"id":"D014012","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetoencephalography","uri":{"id":"D015225","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431567","title":"The Application of Electro- and Magneto-Encephalography in Tinnitus Research - Methods and Interpretations.","year":"2014"}

Fornix FA is consistently decreased in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, decreased fornix FA is one of the earliest MRI abnormalities observed in cognitively normal individuals who are at an increased risk for AD, such as in pre-symptomatic carriers of familial AD mutations and in pre-clinical AD. Reductions of FA at these early stages, which predicted the decline in memory function. Fornix carries the efferent projections from the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and subiculum, connecting these structures to the septal nuclei, anterior thalamic nucleus, mammillary bodies, and medial hypothalamus. Fornix also carries the afferent cholinergic and GABAergic projections from the medial septal nuclei and the adjacent diagonal band back to the medial temporal lobe, interconnecting the core limbic structures. Because fornix carries the axons projecting from the hippocampus, integrity of the fornix is in-part linked to the integrity of the hippocampus. In keeping with that, fornix FA is reduced in subjects with hippocampal atrophy, correlating with memory function.

This signature is dominated by neuroinflammatory processes, specifically activation of the complement system at the level of increased gene expression, while de-regulation of neuronal plasticity appears to be mediated by compromised RNA splicing.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in cellular neuroscience","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splicing","uri":{"id":"D012326","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alzheimer Disease","uri":{"id":"D000544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Young Adult","uri":{"id":"D055815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neuronal Plasticity","uri":{"id":"D009473","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splicing","uri":{"id":"D012326","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Editing","uri":{"id":"D017393","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alternative Splicing","uri":{"id":"D017398","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, RNA","uri":{"id":"D017423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurons","uri":{"id":"D009474","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plastics","uri":{"id":"D010969","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hippocampus","uri":{"id":"D006624","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431548","title":"De-regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing affects distinct cellular pathways in the aging hippocampus.","year":"2014"}

A study examined how anhedonic depressive symptoms, measured continuously across a wide range of severity, influenced the physiological mobilization of effort during a cognitive task. Using motivational intensity theory as a guide, we expected that the diminished incentive value associated with anhedonic depressive symptoms would reduce effort during a \"do your best\" challenge (also known as an unfixed or self-paced challenge), in which effort is a function of the value of achieving the task's goal. Using impedance cardiography, two cardiac autonomic responses were assessed: pre-ejection period (PEP), a measure of sympathetic activity and our primary measure of interest, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic activity. As expected, PEP slowed from baseline to task as anhedonic depressive symptoms increased (as measured with the DASS Depression scale), indicating diminished effort-related sympathetic activity. No significant effects appeared for RSA. The findings support motivational intensity theory as a translational model of effort processes in depression and clarify some inconsistent effects of depressive symptoms on effort-related physiology found in past work.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Motivation and emotion","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arrhythmia, Sinus","uri":{"id":"D001146","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiography, Impedance","uri":{"id":"D002307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arrhythmias, Cardiac","uri":{"id":"D001145","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiology","uri":{"id":"D010827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reward","uri":{"id":"D012201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electric Impedance","uri":{"id":"D017097","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anhedonia","uri":{"id":"D059445","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431505","title":"Effort Deficits and Depression: The Influence of Anhedonic Depressive Symptoms on Cardiac Autonomic Activity During a Mental Challenge.","year":"2014"}

Despite the importance of physiology in this process, previous studies have reported only indirect measures of weaning stress from infants, because of the difficulties of collecting physiological measures from free-ranging mammalian infants. Here we present some of the first data on the relationship between weaning and energetic and psychological stress in infant mammals. We collected data on 47 free-ranging rhesus macaque infants on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico, showing that faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations were directly related to the frequency of maternal rejection, with fGCM concentrations increasing as rates of rejection increased. Infants with higher fGCM concentrations also engaged in higher rates of mother following, and mother following was associated with increased time on the nipple, suggesting that infants that experienced greater weaning-related stress increased their efforts to maintain proximity and contact with their mothers. Infants experiencing more frequent rejection uttered more distress vocalizations when being rejected; however, there was no relationship between rates of distress vocalizations and fGCM concentrations, suggesting a disassociation between behavioural and physiological stress responses to weaning. Elevated glucocorticoid concentrations during weaning may function to mobilize energy reserves and prepare the infant for continued maternal rejection and shortage of energetic resources.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Animal behaviour","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Puerto Rico","uri":{"id":"D011647","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Macaca mulatta","uri":{"id":"D008253","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Physiological","uri":{"id":"D013312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Psychological","uri":{"id":"D013315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glucocorticoids","uri":{"id":"D005938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant","uri":{"id":"D007223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Macaca","uri":{"id":"D008251","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mammals","uri":{"id":"D008322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiology","uri":{"id":"D010827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primates","uri":{"id":"D011323","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Weaning","uri":{"id":"D014886","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nipples","uri":{"id":"D009558","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431499","title":"Physiological and behavioural responses to weaning conflict in free-ranging primate infants.","year":"2014"}

We compared the disease control with protocolized treatment adjustment following a tight control strategy utilizing either the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) or the CDAI. METHODS: In a prospective 12 month study, DMARD-naive RA patients were randomized to either a CDAI or SDAI arm and were treated with traditional DMARDs, increased on a monthly basis according to a predefined protocol to achieve low disease activity. RESULTS: Of 102 patients (84 females, 96 Black Africans), the mean symptom duration was 3.0 years (s.d. 3.8) and the mean 28-joint DAS (DAS28) at baseline was 6.2 (s.d. 1.2). By 12 months, the proportion of patients in the CDAI and SDAI groups achieving low disease activity (30% and 32%) and remission (33 and 34%) were similar. There were no significant differences in the mean DAS28 or its components or in HAQ Disability Index or health-related quality of life scores. Baseline predictors of low disease activity at 12 months were shorter symptom duration (P = 0.03) and lower HAQ-DI score (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Given that the CDAI performed as well as the SDAI, and considering the cost savings and convenience because no acute phase reactant test is necessary, we suggest the CDAI may be an appropriate tool for monthly disease activity monitoring as part of a tight control strategy in developing countries.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ambulatory Care Facilities","uri":{"id":"D000554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acute-Phase Proteins","uri":{"id":"D000209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developing Countries","uri":{"id":"D003906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality of Life","uri":{"id":"D011788","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developed Countries","uri":{"id":"D019049","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Clinical Protocols","uri":{"id":"D002985","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D009800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cost Savings","uri":{"id":"D017046","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Income","uri":{"id":"D007182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044383","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431484","title":"Tight control of rheumatoid arthritis in a resource-constrained setting: a randomized controlled study comparing the clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2005-2010 data from a US commercial health plan. Eligible patients had two or more physician diagnoses of RA during a baseline period of at least 180 days with continuous medical and pharmacy coverage. We computed age-adjusted incidence rates of MI and IS, and used spline regression to assess non-linear associations and Cox-regression to quantify the independent association between the laboratory values and the outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 44 418 eligible RA patients (mean age 49 years; 76% women). CRP>10 mg/L compared with <1 mg/L was associated with increased MI risk (HR 2.12; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.38). ESR>42 mm/h compared with <14 mm/h was associated with increased risk of MI (HR 2.53; 95% CI 1.48 to 4.31) and IS (HR 2.51; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.75) risk. HDL-cholesterol ≥60 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L) compared with <40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) was associated with reduced MI risk (HR 0.37; 0.21 to 0.66). The association between LDL and MI was not linear; the lowest risk was observed among patients with LDL between 70 mg/L (1.8 mmol/L) and 100 mg/L (2.6 mmol/L). We did not observe a significant association between LDL and IS.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Resistant hypertension continues to pose a major challenge to clinicians worldwide and has serious implications for patients who are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with this diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy for resistant hypertension follows guidelines-based regimens although there is surprisingly scant evidence for beneficial outcomes using additional drug treatment after three antihypertensives have failed to achieve target blood pressure. Recently there has been considerable interest in the use of endoluminal renal denervation as an interventional technique to achieve renal nerve ablation and lower blood pressure. Although initial clinical trials of renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension demonstrated encouraging office blood pressure reduction, a large randomised control trial (Symplicity HTN-3) with a sham-control limb, failed to meet its primary efficacy end point. The trial however was subject to a number of flaws which must be taken into consideration in interpreting the final results. Moreover a substantial body of evidence from non-randomised smaller trials does suggest that renal denervation may have an important role in the management of hypertension and other disease states characterised by overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The Joint UK Societies does not recommend the use of renal denervation for treatment of resistant hypertension in routine clinical practice but remains committed to supporting research activity in this field. A number of research strategies are identified and much that can be improved upon to ensure better design and conduct of future randomised studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Heart (British Cardiac Society)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Pressure","uri":{"id":"D001794","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nervous System","uri":{"id":"D009420","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research","uri":{"id":"D012106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sympathetic Nervous System","uri":{"id":"D013564","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypertension","uri":{"id":"D006973","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Morbidity","uri":{"id":"D009017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pressure","uri":{"id":"D011312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Cessation Products","uri":{"id":"D061485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antihypertensive Agents","uri":{"id":"D000959","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Denervation","uri":{"id":"D003714","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431461","title":"Joint UK societies' 2014 consensus statement on renal denervation for resistant hypertension.","year":"2014"}

Rapid changes in the immunological profile post partum and consequent rebound of the inflammatory response may result in hepatic flares. METHODS: Women with chronic hepatitis B were recruited during pregnancy into this observational study. Demographic and clinical data were collected together with virological and biochemical parameters at two time points during pregnancy (early and late) and two time points post partum (between 6 weeks and 12 weeks and at 12 months). Outcomes analysed included changes in HBV DNA, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status and flares of hepatitis. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six women were recruited. Twenty-seven women out of 108 with postpartum bloods (25%) met our definition of a postpartum flare (ALT range 38-1654). Using univariate analysis HBeAg status, younger age, gravida and parity were associated with a flare. On multivariate analysis HBeAg positivity at baseline fell just outside of statistical significance in predicting a postpartum flare (p=0.051). CONCLUSIONS: 25% of women with chronic hepatitis B will demonstrate increased liver inflammation in the postpartum period. This is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously. This is more likely if the woman is HBeAg-positive at baseline (2.56 times the risk), although flares also commonly occur in HBeAg-negative women.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Gut","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B Antigens","uri":{"id":"D006511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B e Antigens","uri":{"id":"D006513","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Time-to-Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D061685","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis, Chronic","uri":{"id":"D006521","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnant Women","uri":{"id":"D037841","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Postpartum Period","uri":{"id":"D049590","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B","uri":{"id":"D006509","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B e Antigens","uri":{"id":"D006513","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B, Chronic","uri":{"id":"D019694","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antigens","uri":{"id":"D000941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis","uri":{"id":"D006505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inflammation","uri":{"id":"D007249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parity","uri":{"id":"D010298","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Postpartum Period","uri":{"id":"D049590","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B e Antigens","uri":{"id":"D006513","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431458","title":"Clinical and virological predictors of hepatic flares in pregnant women with chronic hepatitis B.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: A major cause of enteric infection, Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria activate mucosal inflammation through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to intestinal toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Breast feeding lowers risk of disease, and human milk modulates inflammation. OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether human milk oligosaccharides (HMOSs) influence pathogenic Escherichia coli-induced interleukin (IL)-8 release by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), identified specific proinflammatory signalling molecules modulated by HMOSs, specified the active HMOS and determined its mechanism of action. METHODS: Models of inflammation were IECs invaded by type 1 pili enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in vitro: T84 modelled mature, and H4 modelled immature IECs. LPS-induced signalling molecules co-varying with IL-8 release in the presence or absence of HMOSs were identified. Knockdown and overexpression verified signalling mediators. The oligosaccharide responsible for altered signalling was identified. RESULTS: HMOSs attenuated LPS-dependent induction of IL-8 caused by ETEC, uropathogenic E. coli, and adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) infection, and suppressed CD14 transcription and translation. CD14 knockdown recapitulated HMOS-induced attenuation. Overexpression of CD14 increased the inflammatory response to ETEC and sensitivity to inhibition by HMOSs. 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), at milk concentrations, displayed equivalent ability as total HMOSs to suppress CD14 expression, and protected AIEC-infected mice. CONCLUSIONS: HMOSs and 2'-FL directly inhibit LPS-mediated inflammation during ETEC invasion of T84 and H4 IECs through attenuation of CD14 induction. CD14 expression mediates LPS-TLR4 stimulation of portions of the 'macrophage migration inhibitory factors' inflammatory pathway via suppressors of cytokine signalling 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/NF-κB. HMOS direct inhibition of inflammation supports its functioning as an innate immune system whereby the mother protects her vulnerable neonate through her milk. 2'-FL, a principal HMOS, quenches inflammatory signalling.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Gut","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptional

VA provides care to many persons with PTSD and has been in the forefront of clinical practice guidelines and EBP training and dissemination. Yet VA continues to find EBP implementation difficult. Veterans with PTSD often initially present to prescribing clinicians, who then help make care decisions. It is therefore critical that these clinicians correctly screen and triage appropriate mental health care. The purpose of this study was to assess VA prescribing clinicians' knowledge, perceptions, and referral behaviors related to EBPs for PTSD and to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing EBPs within VA. We conducted qualitative interviews with 26 VA prescribing clinicians. Limited access to EBPs was the most commonly noted barrier. The clinicians we interviewed also held specific beliefs and behaviors that may delay or deter EBPs. Strategies to improve utilization also emerged. Findings suggest the need for increased access to EBPs, training to optimize the role of prescribing clinicians in helping Veterans with PTSD make appropriate care decisions, and specific organizational changes to facilitate access and effective referral systems for EBPs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organizational Innovation","uri":{"id":"D009936","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","uri":{"id":"D013313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perception","uri":{"id":"D010465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Veterans","uri":{"id":"D014728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011613","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","uri":{"id":"D013313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Triage","uri":{"id":"D014218","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431445","title":"Prescribing Clinicians' Perspectives on Evidence-Based Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.","year":"2014"}

Our aim was to evaluate the effect of induction therapy with short-term high-dose ivCY followed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on disease parameters, mortality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis. METHODS: Between January 2003 and November 2006, 71 patients with biopsy-proven proliferative lupus nephritis were included in the second Dutch Lupus Nephritis Study. All patients were treated with ivCY (750 mg÷m2, six monthly pulses) plus oral prednisone, followed by MMF (2000 mg÷day) plus oral prednisone for 18 months, and then azathioprine (2 mg÷kg÷day) plus oral prednisone. Study endpoints included the occurrence of renal relapse, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3.8 years (range 0.1-4.5), four (5.6%) of the 71 patients had a renal relapse, one (1.4%) failed treatment, one (1.4%) reached ESRD, and two (2.8%) died. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Disease Activity Index, serum creatinine, proteinuria and antibodies against anti-dsDNA decreased significantly during treatment and serum levels of complement factor 3 and 4 increased significantly. Furthermore, six of eight domains of the Short Form-36 as well as the number of symptoms and total distress level according to the SLE Symptom Checklist improved significantly over time.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of clinically relevant ECG abnormalities in patients with a hip fracture versus controls. METHODS: The study was designed as a case-control study within consecutive hip surgery patients in an academic hospital. CASES: patients with traumatic hip fractures. CONTROLS: patients undergoing planned hip surgery (non-traumatic). CASES and controls were 1:1 matched for age and gender. INCLUSION CRITERIA: age &#8805; 50 years. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: high-energy trauma, pathological and÷or previous hip fracture. ECGs were scored using predefined categories. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and to correct for confounders. RESULTS: We included 888 patients (444 cases). Mean age was 70.9 years (SD 9.3), 70% were female. After correction for potential confounders we found the following associations between clinically relevant ECG abnormalities and hip fractures: atrial fibrillation OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.2-6.1), abnormal QTc prolongation OR 3.9 (2.2-6.8), sinus tachycardia OR 5.0 (2.1-11.8) and sinus bradycardia OR 0.3 (0.1-0.5). Univariately, several markers for decreased cardiac function were also associated with hip fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture patients are at higher risk for ECG abnormalities than matched patients undergoing hip surgery for other indications. To potentially reduce the risk of future (injurious) falls, increased awareness of these ECG abnormalities is warranted to assess the need for further cardiovascular fall risk assessment.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Netherlands journal of medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atrial Fibrillation","uri":{"id":"D001281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tachycardia, Sinus","uri":{"id":"D013616","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Odds Ratio","uri":{"id":"D016017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Case-Control Studies","uri":{"id":"D016022","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Assessment","uri":{"id":"D018570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hip Fractures","uri":{"id":"D006620","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Awareness","uri":{"id":"D001364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bradycardia","uri":{"id":"D001919","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrocardiography","uri":{"id":"D004562","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tachycardia","uri":{"id":"D013610","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431390","title":"Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients admitted for hip fracture.","year":"2014"}

There are substantial differences in levels of nicotine dependence by race and ethnic group. METHODS: Data from Wave III of the multiracial National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed for young smokers between the ages of 21 and 28 (N = 1,425). Time to first cigarette data was compared between Hispanic, White, Black, Native American, and Asian smokers. RESULTS: Black smokers were significantly more likely to smoke within 5min of waking than White, Hispanic, and Asian smokers. Lower personal income predicted smoking within 5min of waking for both White and Black smokers. For White smokers, increased number of cigarettes per day and increased years of smoking also predicted smoking within 5min of waking. The number of days smoked or number of cigarettes per day did not predict smoking within 5min of waking among smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of early TTFC among Blacks indicates increased nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and may help explain the increased lung cancer rates and failed cessation attempts among Black smokers. TTFC may be an important screening item, independent of cigarettes per day, for clinicians and interventions to identify those at highest risk for cessation failure and disease risk.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Americans","uri":{"id":"D001213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ethnic Groups","uri":{"id":"D005006","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D008175","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Indians, North American","uri":{"id":"D007198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Disorder","uri":{"id":"D014029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health","uri":{"id":"D063588","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogens","uri":{"id":"D002273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hispanic Americans","uri":{"id":"D006630","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Income","uri":{"id":"D007182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung","uri":{"id":"D008168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044382","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044383","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"European Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Continental Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Niacin","uri":{"id":"D009525","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nicotine","uri":{"id":"D009538","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Products","uri":{"id":"D062789","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431372","title":"Predictors of the Nicotine Dependence Behavior Time to the First Cigarette in a Multiracial Cohort.","year":"2014"}

C-reactive protein (CRP) and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have demonstrated prognostic value in some cancers. The role of CRP and NLR in predicting outcome in pancreatic cancer after curative resection is not well established. METHODS: An electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL was performed to identify studies assessing survival in patients after pancreatic cancer resection with high or low pre-operative CRP or NLR. Systematic review was undertaken using the PRISMA protocol. RESULTS: In total, 327 studies were identified with 10 reporting on survival outcomes after a pancreatic resection in patients with high or low CRP, NLR or both. All but one paper showed a trend of lower inflammatory markers in patients with longer survival. Three studies from six showed low CRP to be independently associated with increased survival and two studies of eight showed the same for NLR. All studies were retrospective cohort studies of low to moderate quality. DISCUSSION: Inflammatory markers might prove useful guides to the management of resectable pancreatic cancer but, given the poor quality of evidence, further longitudinal studies are required before incorporating pre-operative inflammatory markers into clinical decision making.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retrospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D012189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Selection","uri":{"id":"D018579","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"C-Reactive Protein","uri":{"id":"D002097","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Decision Making","uri":{"id":"D003657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronics","uri":{"id":"D004581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrons","uri":{"id":"D004583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pancreatitis","uri":{"id":"D010195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"MEDLINE","uri":{"id":"D016239","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431369","title":"Prognostic significance of pre-operative C-reactive protein and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in resectable pancreatic cancer: a systematic review.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells are resistant to cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor ligands such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Recently, genetic alterations in cell death pathways, including inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, have been demonstrated in HNSCC. We investigated the effects of birinapant, a novel, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)-mimetic that targets inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, alone and in combination with TNFα, TRAIL, or chemotherapy docetaxel. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study using human HNSCC cell lines in vitro and xenograft mouse model in vivo. METHODS: A panel of HNSCC cell lines with varying genetic alterations in cell death pathway components were treated with birinapant ± TNFα, TRAIL, and docetaxel and were assessed for effects on cell density, cell cycle, and death. Synergism was determined at varying concentrations of treatments using the Chou-Talalay method. Combination studies using birinapant ± docetaxel were performed in a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: Birinapant, alone or in combination with TNFα or TRAIL, decreased cell density in cell lines, with IC50 s ranging from 0.5 nM to > 1 µM. Birinapant alone or with TNF significantly increased subG0 cell death in different lines. Docetaxel showed synergism with birinapant ± TNFα in vitro. Birinapant monotherapy-inhibited growth in a tumor xenograft model resistant to docetaxel, and combination treatment further delayed growth. CONCLUSIONS: Birinapant alone or in combination with TNFα or TRAIL and docetaxel decreased cell density, increased cell death, and displayed antitumor activity in a preclinical HNSCC xenograft exhibiting aberrations in cell death pathway components and docetaxel resistance.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association of hyperkyphosis and physical function in 2,363 men, aged 71-98 (M = 79) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. Kyphosis was measured using the Rancho Bernardo Study block method. Measurements of grip strength and lower extremity function, including gait speed over 6 m, narrow walk (measure of dynamic balance), repeated chair stands ability and time, and lower extremity power (Nottingham Power Rig) were included separately as primary outcomes. We investigated associations of kyphosis and each outcome in age-adjusted and multivariable linear or logistic regression models, controlling for age, clinic, education, race, bone mineral density, height, weight, diabetes, and physical activity. RESULTS: In multivariate linear regression, we observed a dose-related response of worse scores on each lower extremity physical function test as number of blocks increased, p for trend ≤.001. Using a cutoff of ≥4 blocks, 20% (N = 469) of men were characterized with hyperkyphosis. In multivariate logistic regression, men with hyperkyphosis had increased odds (range 1.5-1.8) of being in the worst quartile of performing lower extremity physical function tasks (p < .001 for each outcome). Kyphosis was not associated with grip strength in any multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkyphosis is associated with impaired lower extremity physical function in older men. Further studies are needed to determine the direction of causality.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The journals of gerontology.

Whether standard prognostic variables have differential utility in various age groups is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: The PROTECT trial investigated 2033 patients (median age 72 years) with acute HF randomized to rolofylline or placebo. Patients were divided into five groups based on the quintiles of age: ≤59, 60-68, 69-74, 75-79, and ≥80 years. Baseline characteristics, medications, and outcomes (30-day death or cardiovascular/renal hospitalization, and death at 30 and 180 days) were explored. The prognostic utility of baseline characteristics for outcomes was investigated in the different groups and in those aged <80 years vs. ≥80 years. With increasing age, patients were more likely to be women with hypertension, AF, and higher EF. Increased age was associated with increased risk of 30- and 180-day outcomes, which persisted after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio for 180-day death = 1.17; 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.24 for each 5-year increase). The prognostic utility of baseline characteristics such as previous HF hospitalization and serum sodium, systolic blood pressure, and NYHA class was attenuated in the elderly for the endpoint of 180-day mortality. An increase in albumin was associated with a greater reduction in risk in patients aged ≥80 years vs. <80 years. CONCLUSIONS: In a large trial of acute HF, there were differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes amongst patients of different ages. Standard prognostic variables exhibit different utility in elderly patients.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of heart failure","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Pressure","uri":{"id":"D001794","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Pressure","uri":{"id":"D001794","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Failure","uri":{"id":"D006333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age Groups","uri":{"id":"D009273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Albumins","uri":{"id":"D000418","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypertension","uri":{"id":"D006973","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pressure","uri":{"id":"D011312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sodium","uri":{"id":"D012964","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Systole","uri":{"id":"D013599","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431336","title":"Acute heart failure in elderly patients: worse outcomes and differential utility of standard prognostic variables.

In this study, we used gain and loss of function approaches to investigate the role of Hes1 in cardioprotection during IPost. Primary cardiac myocytes exposed to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and IPost were used as the experimental model. The results showed that Hes1 expression was increased during myocardial IPost, and Hes1 promoted the viability while inhibited the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Hes1 inhibited the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cardiac myocytes exposed to IRI. Mechanistically, we found that Hes1-mediated cardioprotection was related to the downregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signalling. These data demonstrate that Hes1 is upregulated and mediates cardioprotection provided by IPost and suggest that Hes1 is a potential new target for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

A multifaceted implementation strategy was developed to implement a guideline to prevent hand eczema among healthcare workers. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the implementation strategy on self-reported hand eczema and preventive behaviour. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed. A total of 48 departments (n = 1649) were randomly allocated to the multifaceted implementation strategy or the control group. The strategy consisted of education, participatory working groups, and role models. Outcome measures were self-reported hand eczema and preventive behaviour. Data were collected at baseline, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group were significantly more likely to report hand eczema [odds ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.04], and they reported significantly less hand washing (B, - 0.38; 95% CI - 0.48 to - 0.27), reported significantly more frequent use of a moisturizer (B, 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.39) and were more likely to report wearing cotton undergloves (OR 6.33; 95% CI 3.23-12.41) than participants in the control group 12 months after baseline.

This study investigated differences in epithelial hormone receptor immunoreactivity and stromal cell calretinin, CD34 and p16 expression in morphologically normal secretory endometrium and in asynchronous (non-secretory) endometrial glands (AEGs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen consecutive endometrial specimens demonstrating AEGs were examined. The mean age was 42.8 years and the most common presenting symptom was menorrhagia. Immunohistological expression of oestrogen receptor (ER)α, ERβ and progesterone receptor was compared in normal secretory glands and in AEGs. Stromal cell expression of calretinin, CD34 and p16 was also investigated. In contrast to normal secretory glands, the epithelial cells lining AEGs were usually ERα/PR positive and showed significantly increased ERβ expression. Altered calretinin and CD34 expression within functional layer stromal cells was seen in 5 and 2 cases, respectively, but there were no differences in stromal cell immunoreactivity around AEGs. CONCLUSIONS: The most common clinical symptom associated with AEGs in this study was menorrhagia. Aberrant hormone receptor expression in AEGs suggests a localized, possibly clonal, defect in epithelial maturation. There were no immunophenotypic changes to suggest that AEGs are related to a primary endometrial stromal deficiency. This article is protected by copyright.

In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, 15 668 persons aged 20-56 years underwent spirometry in 1991-1993 and 9 years later (n = 8916). Risk of airway obstruction and lung function decline associated with smoking and early-onset (<10 years of age) and late-onset (>10 years of age) asthma were analysed with generalised estimating equation models and random-effect linear models, adjusting for covariates. Interaction of asthma with smoking was expressed as relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). A 20-fold increase in adult airway obstruction was found among those with early-onset asthma independently of smoking status (never smokers: OR 21.0, 95% CI 12.7-35; current smokers: OR 23.7, 95% CI 13.9-40.6). Late-onset asthma was associated with airway obstruction, with a stronger association among current smokers (OR 25.6, 95% CI 15.6-41.9) than among never-smokers (OR 11.2, 95% CI 6.8-18.6) (RERI 12.02, 95% CI 1.96-22.07). Stratifying by atopy, the association between smoking and asthma was most pronounced among nonatopics.

The dual HCRT receptor antagonist almorexant (ALM) decreases waking and increases sleep. We hypothesized that HCRT antagonists induce sleep, in part, through disfacilitation of BF neurons; consequently, ALM should have reduced efficacy in BF-lesioned (BFx) animals. To test this hypothesis, rats were given bilateral IgG-192-saporin injections, which predominantly targets cholinergic BF neurons. BFx and intact rats were then given oral ALM, the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem (ZOL) or vehicle (VEH) at lights-out. ALM was less effective than ZOL at inducing sleep in BFx rats compared to controls. BF adenosine (ADO), γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate levels were then determined via microdialysis from intact, freely behaving rats following oral ALM, ZOL or VEH. ALM increased BF ADO and GABA levels during waking and mixed vigilance states, and preserved sleep-associated increases in GABA under low and high sleep pressure conditions. ALM infusion into the BF also enhanced cortical ADO release, demonstrating that HCRT input is critical for ADO signaling in the BF. In contrast, oral ZOL and BF-infused ZOL had no effect on ADO levels in either BF or cortex. ALM increased BF ADO (an endogenous sleep-promoting substance) and GABA (which is increased during normal sleep), and required an intact BF for maximal efficacy, whereas ZOL blocked sleep-associated BF GABA release, and required no functional contribution from the BF to induce sleep. ALM thus induces sleep by facilitating the neural mechanisms underlying the normal transition to sleep.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Brain structure & function","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cholinergic Neurons","uri":{"id":"D059329","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenosine","uri":{"id":"D000241","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","uri":{"id":"D005680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamates","uri":{"id":"D005971","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurons","uri":{"id":"D009474","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pressure","uri":{"id":"D011312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamic Acid","uri":{"id":"D018698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Benzodiazepines","uri":{"id":"D001569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Synaptic Transmission","uri":{"id":"D009435","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prosencephalon","uri":{"id":"D016548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microdialysis","uri":{"id":"D017551","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cholinergic Agents","uri":{"id":"D018678","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431268","title":"Hypocretin/orexin antagonism enhances sleep-related adenosine and GABA neurotransmission in rat basal forebrain.","year":"2014"}

We compared age-related changes in glycaemic traits between non-diabetic South Asian and white participants. METHODS: In a prospective British occupational cohort with 5-yearly clinical examinations (n = 230/5,749 South Asian/white participants, age 39-79 years at baseline), age-related trajectories of fasting glucose (FG) and 2 h post-load glucose (PLG), log-transformed fasting insulin (FINS) and 2 h post-load insulin (PLINS), HOMA insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) and HOMA insulin secretion (HOMA2-%B) were fitted for South Asian and white individuals who remained free of diabetes between 1991 and 2009. RESULTS: In sex-adjusted multilevel models, FG was stable in white participants but increased with age in South Asians (0.12 [SE = 0.04] mmol/l per decade). PLG, FINS and PLINS levels were lower among white participants (by 0.271 [SE = 0.092] mmol/l, 0.306 [SE = 0.046] log pmol/l, 0.707 [SE = 0.059] log pmol/l at age 50, respectively) compared with South Asians, although their age-related trajectories were parallel. HOMA2-%S was higher (0.226 [SE = 0.038] at age 50) and HOMA2-%B lower (by 0.189 [SE = 0.026] at age 50) among white than South Asian participants. The age-related decline in HOMA2-%S was similar in these groups, but the age-related increase in HOMA2-%B was greater in white participants (0.04 [SE = 0.02] per decade). This difference was explained by obesity, lifestyle and social status.

It is crucial to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and improve the success of endocrine therapies. Splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1) mutations are described in luminal breast cancer albeit in low frequency. In this study, we evaluated the role of SF3B1 and SF3B3, critical parts of the SF3b splicing complex, in ER-positive endocrine resistance. To ascertain the role of SF3B1/SF3B3 in endocrine resistance, their expression levels were evaluated in ER-positive/endocrine-resistant cell lines (MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9) using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To further determine their clinical relevance, expression analysis was performed in a cohort of 60 paraffin-embedded ER-positive, node-negative breast carcinomas with low, intermediate, and high Oncotype DX recurrence scores. Expression levels of SF3B1 and SF3B3 and their prognostic value were validated in large cohorts using publicly available gene expression data sets including The Cancer Genome Atlas. SF3B1 and SF3B3 levels were significantly increased in ERα-positive cells with acquired tamoxifen (MCF-7/LCC2; both P<0.0002) and fulvestrant/tamoxifen resistance (MCF-7/LCC9; P=0.008 for SF3B1 and P=0.0006 for SF3B3). Expression levels of both MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9 were not affected by additional treatments with E2 and/or tamoxifen. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that SF3B3 expression is significantly upregulated in Oncotype DX high-risk groups when compared with low risk (P=0.019). Similarly, in publicly available breast cancer gene expression data sets, overexpression of SF3B3, but not SF3B1, was significantly correlated with overall survival. Furthermore, the correlation was significant in ER-positive, but not in ER-negative tumors.This is the first study to document the role of SF3B3 in endocrine resistance and prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to characterize the histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of sinonasal IM. Histologic slides from 29 consecutive surgical specimens of ITAC were retrieved. Sections were stained for CDX2, cytokeratin 20 (CK20), MUC2, and p53. The status of TP53 gene exons 4-9 was assessed separately in areas of IM and in ITAC. Foci of IM were detected in eight cases (27.5 %). They were all positive for CK20 and CDX2, while MUC2 was detected in six cases (75 %). In six cases (75 %), the metaplastic foci showed signs of dysplasia, including nuclear enlargement with increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, nuclear hyperchromasia, loss of nuclear polarity, and presence of prominent nucleoli. P53 nuclear immunoreactivity was observed in four cases. TP53 gene sequencing was successfully performed in six cases and revealed the same mutation in both IM and ITAC in two cases (c.832C > T and c.215G > C), while another ITAC showed a mutation that was not present in the adjacent IM (c.536A > G). In conclusion, our study suggests a possible clonal relationship between areas of sinonasal IM and ITAC, indicating that IM may represent a precursor lesion of ITAC. Improving the knowledge on the morphological and molecular features of IM is a key step to identify reliable biomarkers to determine the risk of sinonasal ITAC development.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, p53","uri":{"id":"D016158","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Keratin-20","uri":{"id":"D053554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenocarcinoma","uri":{"id":"D000230","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytoplasm","uri":{"id":"D003593","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epithelium","uri":{"id":"D004848","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exons","uri":{"id":"D005091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intestines","uri":{"id":"D007422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Keratins","uri":{"id":"D007633","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mucous Membrane","uri":{"id":"D009092","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metaplasia","uri":{"id":"D008679","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431194","title":"Intestinal metaplasia of the sinonasal mucosa adjacent to intestinal-type adenocarcinoma.

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the MDM2 intronic promoter (P2) have been found to exert biological function. The G-allele of SNP309T>G; rs2279744 increases MDM2 transcription and has been linked to increased cancer risk. In contrast, the less frequent SNP285G>C; rs117039649, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with SNP309 (generating a SNP285C/309G variant haplotype), has been related to reduced MDM2 transcription and to reduced risk of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer. In this large population-based case-control study, we genotyped SNP309 and SNP285in 10,830 individuals, including cases with cancer of the breast (n=1,717), colon (n=1,532), lung (n=1,331) and prostate (n=2,501), as well as 3,749 non-cancer controls. We found a slightly reduced risk for lung cancer among individuals harboring the SNP309TG/GG genotypes compared to the SNP309TT genotype (OR= 0.86; CI = 0.67 - 0.98), but this association was restricted to women (OR = 0.77; CI = 0.63 - 0.95) and was not present among men (OR = 0.91; CI = 0.77 - 1.08). Consistent with previous findings, we found a reduced risk for breast cancer among individuals carrying the SNP285GC/309GG genotype versus SNP285GG/309GG genotype (OR = 0.55; CI = 0.33 - 0.93).

Although it is well known that polymers based on amorphous poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) have a fundamental limit to their efficiency because of low carrier mobility, which leads to increased recombination and unbalanced charge extraction, herein, we demonstrate that the issue can be overcome by forming bimolecular crystals of an amorphous PPV-based polymer:phenyl-C61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) intercalated structure. We used amorphous poly(2,5-dioctyloxy-p-phenylene vinylene-alt-2',5'-thienylene vinylene) (PPVTV), which has a simple chemical structure. A reasonably high power conversion efficiency (∼3.5 %) was obtained, although the material has an intrinsically amorphous structure and a relatively large band gap (2.0 eV). We demonstrate a correlation between a well-ordered bimolecular crystal of PPVTV:PCBM and an improved hole mobility of a PPVTV:PCBM film compared to a pristine PPVTV film by using 2 D grazing incidence XRD and space-charge-limited current measurements. Furthermore, we show that the bimolecular crystal structure in high-performance OPVs is related to an optimum molecular packing, which is influenced by the PPVTV:PCBM blending ratio, side-chain length, and molecular weight of the PPVTV polymer. Improved charge transport in PPVTV:PCBM bimolecular crystals leads to a fast sweep out of charges and thus suppression of nongeminate recombination under the operating conditions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"ChemSusChem","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Butyrates","uri":{"id":"D002087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Weight","uri":{"id":"D008970","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Butyric Acid","uri":{"id":"D020148","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Butyrates","uri":{"id":"D002087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esters","uri":{"id":"D004952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fees and Charges","uri":{"id":"D005249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methylation","uri":{"id":"D008745","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymers","uri":{"id":"D011108","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recombination, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D011995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dissociative Disorders","uri":{"id":"D004213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intercalating Agents","uri":{"id":"D007364","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431175","title":"Bimolecular Crystals with an Intercalated Structure Improve Poly(p-phenylenevinylene)-Based Organic Photovoltaic Cells.","year":"2014"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the action of melatonin on hepatic differentiation as well as its related signaling pathways of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and to examine the therapeutic effects of a combination of melatonin and hDPSC transplantation on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced liver fibrosis in mice. In vitro hepatic differentiation was assessed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and mRNA expression for hepatocyte markers. Liver fibrosis model was established by injecting 0.5 ml/kg CCl4 followed by treatment with melatonin (5 mg/kg, twice a week) and hDPSCs. In vivo therapeutic effects were evaluated by histopathology and by means of liver function tests including measurement of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and ammonia levels. Melatonin promoted hepatic differentiation based on mRNA expression of differentiation markers and PAS-stained glycogen-laden cells. In addition, melatonin increased bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 expression and Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, which was blocked by the BMP antagonist noggin. Furthermore, melatonin activated p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in hDPSCs. Melatonin-induced hepatic differentiation was attenuated by inhibitors of BMP, p38, ERK, and NF-κB. Compared to treatment of CCl4 -injured mice with either melatonin or hDPSC transplantation alone, the combination of melatonin and hDPSC significantly suppressed liver fibrosis and restored ALT, AST, and ammonia levels. For the first time, this study demonstrates that melatonin promotes hepatic differentiation of hDPSCs by modulating the BMP, p38, ERK, and NF-κB pathway. Combined treatment of grafted hDPSCs and melatonin could be a viable approach for the treatment of liver cirrhosis. This article is protected by copyright.

In the cases, ADAMTS13 activity levels in the first trimester were moderately-to-severely reduced (median levels <3% in gravidic TTP and median levels 20% [range 14-40%] in the women with miscarriage) and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were invariably present, while in the control group ADAMTS13 activity levels were normal (median 90%, range 40-129%), with absence of detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Reduced levels of ADAMTS13 activity (<25%) in the first trimester were associated with an over 2.9-fold increased risk for gravidic TTP and with an over 1.2-fold increased risk for miscarriage (lower boundary of the confidence interval of the odds ratio).

Patients were divided into tertiles based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard and competing risk models were used to assess relationships between eGFR and subsequent mortality and appropriate ICD therapy. Median eGFR was 37.6, 59.3 and 84.8ml/min for tertiles 1-3, respectively. Five-year Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 34.8, 61.4 and 84.5% for tertiles 1-3, respectively (p<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, compared to tertile 3, worse eGFR tertile was associated with increased mortality (HR 2.84, 95%CI (1.36-5.94) for tertile 2; HR 3.84, 95%CI (1.81-8.12) for tertile 1). At 5 years, 57.0, 58.1, and 60.2% of patients remained free of appropriate ICD therapy in tertiles 1-3, respectively (p = 0.82). After adjustment, eGFR tertile was not associated with future appropriate ICD therapy. Results were unchanged in an adjusted competing risk model accounting for death. CONCLUSIONS: At time of first ICD generator replacement, lower eGFR is associated with higher mortality, but not with appropriate ICD therapies. The poorer survival of ICD patients with reduced eGFR does not appear to be influenced by arrhythmia status, and there is no clear proarrhythmic effect of renal dysfunction, even after accounting for the competing risk of death.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The importance of circadian clocks in the regulation of adult physiology in mammals is well established. In contrast, the ontogenesis of the circadian system and its role in embryonic development are still poorly understood. Although there is experimental evidence that the clock machinery is present prior to birth, data on gestational clock functionality are inconsistent. Moreover, little is known about the dependence of embryonic rhythms on maternal and environmental time cues and the role of circadian oscillations for embryonic development. The aim of this study was to test if fetal mouse tissues from early embryonic stages are capable of expressing endogenous, self-sustained circadian rhythms and their contribution to embryogenesis. Starting on embryonic day 13, we collected precursor tissues for suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), liver and kidney from embryos carrying the circadian reporter gene Per2::Luc and investigated rhythmicity and circadian traits of these tissues ex vivo. We found that even before the respective organs were fully developed, embryonic tissues were capable of expressing circadian rhythms. Period and amplitude of which were determined very early during development and phases of liver and kidney explants are not influenced by tissue preparation, whereas SCN explants phasing is strongly dependent on preparation time. Embryonic circadian rhythms also developed in the absence of maternal and environmental time signals. Morphological and histological comparison of offspring from matings of Clock-Δ19 mutant and wild-type mice revealed that both fetal and maternal clocks have distinct roles in embryogenesis. While genetic disruptions of maternal and embryonic clock function leads to increased fetal fat depots, abnormal ossification and organ development, Clock gene mutant newborns from mothers with a functional clock showed a larger body size compared to wild-type littermates. These data may contribute to the understanding of the ontogenesis of circadian clocks and the risk of disturbed maternal or embryonic circadian rhythms for embryonic development.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Chronobiology international","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fetus","uri":{"id":"D005333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Body Size","uri":{"id":"D049628","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Circadian Rhythm","uri":{"id":"D002940","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suprachiasmatic Nucleus","uri":{"id":"D013493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Reporter","uri":{"id":"D017930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Embryonic Development","uri":{"id":"D047108","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Circadian Clocks","uri":{"id":"D057906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cues","uri":{"id":"D003463","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant, Newborn","uri":{"id":"D007231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kidney","uri":{"id":"D007668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mammals","uri":{"id":"D008322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Periodicity","uri":{"id":"D010507","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiology","uri":{"id":"D010827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lifting","uri":{"id":"D017770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Embryonic Development","uri":{"id":"D047108","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431080","title":"Embryonic development and maternal regulation of murine circadian clock function.","year":"2014"}

Transforming growth factor-β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to cause organ dysfunction through alterations in vascular and airway smooth muscle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of TGF-β3 on intestinal smooth muscle function and contractile gene expression. METHODS: Archived human intestinal tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for TGF-β isoforms and markers of smooth muscle gene and micro-RNA contractile phenotype. Intestinal motility was measured in neonatal rats ± TGF-β3 (0.2 and 1 mg/kg). Human intestinal smooth muscle cells (hiSMCs) were incubated with fetal bovine serum ±100 ng/ml of TGF-β 3 isoforms for 6, 24 and 72 h. The effects of TGF-β3 on motility, hiSMC contractility and hiSMC contractile phenotype gene and micro-RNA expression were measured using transit, collagen gel contraction assay and RT-PCR analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, ANOVA (n = 6-7/group). RESULTS: GS infants had increased immunostaining of TGF-β3 and elevated levels of micro-RNA 143 & 145 in the intestinal smooth muscle. Rats had significantly decreased intestinal transit when exposed to TGF-β3 in a dose-dependent manner compared with Sham animals. TGF-β3 significantly increased hiSMC gel contraction and contractile protein gene and micro-RNA expression. CONCLUSION: TGF-β3 contributed to intestinal dysfunction at the organ level, increased contraction at the cellular level and elevated contractile gene expression at the molecular level. A hyper-contractile response may play a role in the persistent intestinal dysfunction seen in GRID.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Digestive diseases and sciences","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gastrointestinal Motility","uri":{"id":"D005769","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Contractile Proteins","uri":{"id":"D003285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscle, Smooth","uri":{"id":"D009130","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscle Cells","uri":{"id":"D032342","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myocytes, Smooth Muscle","uri":{"id":"D032389","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abdominal Wall","uri":{"id":"D034861","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Analysis of Variance","uri":{"id":"D000704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Collagen","uri":{"id":"D003094","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incubators","uri":{"id":"D007185","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant","uri":{"id":"D007223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant, Newborn","uri":{"id":"D007231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intestines","uri":{"id":"D007422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytokines","uri":{"id":"D016207","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Isoforms","uri":{"id":"D020033","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"MicroRNAs","uri":{"id":"D035683","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Archives","uri":{"id":"D001109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gastroschisis","uri":{"id":"D020139","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431043","title":"Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 3 Alters Intestinal Smooth Muscle Function: Implications for Gastroschisis-Related Intestinal Dysfunction.","year":"2014"}

This study aimed to elucidate how an adverse prenatal environment, as defined by the presence of a number of known prenatal risk factors, would influence mental health trajectories in children to 14 years of age. The Raine Study provided comprehensive data from 2,900 pregnancies. Offspring were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). We used linear mixed regression models with random intercept and slope (random effects models) to examine the extent to which the predictor variables considered influenced changes in continuous CBCL total, internalising, and externalising T scores from ages 2 to 14. In the final multivariate models, increased offspring CBCL T scores were significantly predicted by the mother not finishing high school, smoking during pregnancy, having a total family income below the poverty line, being diagnosed with gestational hypertension and experiencing stressful life events during pregnancy. Conversely, as maternal age increased, CBCL T scores were significantly decreased. Child age also significantly interacted with maternal education, total family income, and maternal stressful life events, such that these variables predicted increases in CBCL scores from age 2 to age 10, and from age 2 to age 14 years. In the Raine Study sample, children who experienced adverse prenatal environments experienced increased levels of problem behaviours in childhood, and more problematic mental health trajectories. Maternal health risk behaviours and other psychosocial variables more commonly affected child behaviour than obstetric complications.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European child & adolescent psychiatry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linear Models","uri":{"id":"D016014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maternal Welfare","uri":{"id":"D008429","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Critical Period (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D003423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maternal Age","uri":{"id":"D008423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sampling Studies","uri":{"id":"D012494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Psychological","uri":{"id":"D013315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced","uri":{"id":"D046110","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypertension","uri":{"id":"D006973","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Income","uri":{"id":"D007182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Schools","uri":{"id":"D012574","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Checklist","uri":{"id":"D057189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Obstetrics","uri":{"id":"D009774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poverty","uri":{"id":"D011203","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431038","title":"The association between prenatal environment and children's mental health trajectories from 2 to 14 years.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The long term relationship between hypothyroidism and fracture risk is challenging to dissect due to the modifying influence of subsequent thyroxine replacement with the potential for excessive replacement doses. We studied changes in serum thyrotropin concentration (TSH) over time and association with fracture risk in real world patients presenting with elevated TSH. All TSH determinations were done in the same laboratory, which served all hospitals and General Practices. The study population consisted of all adults with a first measurement of TSH > 4.0 mIU/l (N=8,414) or normal TSH (N=222,138, comparator). We used a Cox Proportional Hazards analysis incorporating additional time dependent covariates to represent initiation of thyroxine replacement and cumulative number of periods with high vs low TSH after index date with a mean follow-up of 7.2 years. Elevated baseline TSH was not associated with an increased risk of hip fracture [HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.80-1.02)] or major osteoporotic fractures [HR (95% CI 0.97 (0.90-1.05)], nor was subsequent thyroxine prescription predictive of increased risk of fractures. The number of subsequent 6 month periods with low TSH - suggesting excessive thyroxine dosing - was significantly associated with increased risk of both hip fracture [HR 1.09 (95% CI 1.04-1.15)] and major osteoporotic fracture [HR 1.10(95% CI 1.06-1.14)]. When gender and age stratified analyses for major osteoporotic fractures were undertaken, hyperthyroid time was identified as a predictor of fracture risk in postmenopausal women while hypothyroid time predicted increased fracture risk in men below age 75. In conclusion, among patients who present with an elevated TSH, the long term risk of hip and other osteoporotic fractures is strongly related to the cumulative duration of periods with low TSH- likely from excessive replacement. An independent effect of elevated TSH could only be observed in young and middle-aged men, suggesting gender discrepant consequences on risk. This article is protected by copyright.

Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics is related to the pathogenesis of several human diseases, its molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate the potential role of miR-27 in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) mRNA is a direct target of miR-27, whose ectopic expression decreases MFF expression through binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Expression of miR-27 results in the elongation of mitochondria as well as an increased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ATP level.

Instead, the safety profile of antipsychotics has been questioned repeatedly in recent years with various concerns, including death. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that one of the major causes of death associated with atypical antipsychotics use was pneumonia. Only few observational studies, however, have investigated the risk of pneumonia in elderly patients, especially among those receiving conventional antipsychotics. The aim of this editorial is to synthesize the current evidence from observational studies regarding the risk of pneumonia in elderly patients receiving either conventional or atypical antipsychotics. The studies conducted so far document that the risk of pneumonia is two- to threefold increased in a dose-dependent fashion with both classes compared to nonuse, with a possibly higher risk attributable to atypical antipsychotics. The risk seems to peak at the beginning of treatment (e.g., 7 - 30 days), and dissipates over time for both conventional and atypical antipsychotics. The risk-benefit ratio suggests that there will be 1 excess hospitalization for pneumonia for every 2 - 5 patients receiving any clinical improvement in symptoms. Considering the modest improvement in terms of efficacy, the risks associated with antipsychotics in elderly patients may outweigh their benefit.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Expert opinion on drug safety","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cause of Death","uri":{"id":"D002423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Off-Label Use","uri":{"id":"D056687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dementia","uri":{"id":"D003704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pneumonia","uri":{"id":"D011014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antipsychotic Agents","uri":{"id":"D014150","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431005","title":"Antipsychotic use in elderly patients and the risk of pneumonia.","year":"2014"}

However, the anti-leukemic activities of N. chinensis have not been well examined. Objective: To investigate the effect of N. chinensis on differentiation and proliferation in the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells. Materials and methods: The dried roots and stems of N. chiensis are extracted using hot water and then freeze-dried. The yield of extract was 12.82% (w/w). The HL-60 cells were treated with 25-200 μg/ml of N. chinensis for 72 h or 100 μg/ml of N. chinensis for 24-72 h. Results: Nardostachys chinensis significantly inhibited cell viability dose dependently with an IC50 of 100 μg/ml in HL-60 cells. Nardostachys chinensis induced differentiation of the cells as measured by reduction activity of NBT and expression of CD11b but not of CD14 as analyzed by flow cytometry, which indicates a differentiation toward the granulocytic lineage. Nardostachys chinensis also induced growth inhibition through G0/G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle of HL-60 cells. Among the G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle-related protein, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27(Kip1) was increased in N. chinensis-treated HL-60 cells, whereas the expression levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E, and cyclin A were decreased. Interestingly, N. chinensis markedly enhanced the binding of p27(Kip1) with CDK2 and CDK6. Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrated that N. chinensis is capable of inducing cellular differentiation and growth inhibition through p27(Kip1) protein-related G0/G1 phase arrest in HL-60

Activation of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) has been examined as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, there are conflicting findings regarding the role of AT2R. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing AT2R by viral vector transduction on the apoptosis and function of pancreatic β-islet cells. The rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1, was transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing AT2R (Ad-G-AT2R-EGFP). AT2R overexpression resulted in significantly reduced cell viability and subsequently impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) function in INS-1 cells. Down-regulated expressions of GSIS pathway components, insulin, glucose transporter 2, and glucokinase were associated with AT2R overexpression. Further analysis determined that overexpression of AT2R induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest and Ang II-independent apoptotic cell death as indicated by increased Annexin V staining. To understand the apoptosis signaling triggered by AT2R overexpression, levels of caspase proteins were measured. Overexpression of AT2R significantly induced caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 cleavage, and decreased Bcl-2, pAkt, and pERK expression levels. AT2R-induced cell apoptosis was successfully blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Our findings suggested that AT2R overexpression triggers the apoptosis of INS-1 cells and dysfunction in insulin secretion. In conclusion, more careful design and consideration are required when applying AT2R-related therapies in treating diabetes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular and cellular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Dipyrone is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used primarily as an analgesic and antipyretic. Some hypothesize that dipyrone activity can modulate other pathways, including endocannabinoid signaling. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of endocannabinoids in mediating dipyrone activity. This study will be based on the tetrad effects of cannabinoids, which are an antinoceptive and cataleptic state, hypolocomotion, and hypothermia. Dipyrone treatment caused a decrease in locomotor activity, increased the latency to a thermal analgesic response, and induced a cataleptic and hypothermic state. These reactions are similar to the tetrad effects caused by the cannabinoid agonist, WIN 55,212-2. CB1 receptor antagonist reversed dipyrone's effects on locomotor activity, the cataleptic response and thermal analgesia. CB1 and TRPV1 antagonists accentuated the reduction in body temperature caused by dipyrone. However, CB2 antagonists did not alter the dipyrone-stimulated hypothermia response. These results indicate involvement of the endocannabinoid system, especially the CB1 receptor, in analgesia and the cataleptic effect and hypolocomotion. However, CB and TRPV1 receptors were not involved in hyporthermic effects.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Overactivity or contractures of the hamstring muscles in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) can lead to either a jump gait (knee flexion associated with ankle plantar flexion) or a crouch gait (knee flexion associated with ankle dorsiflexion). Hamstring lengthening is performed to decrease stance knee flexion. However, this procedure carries the potential risk of weakening hip extension power as well as recurrence over time; therefore, surgeons have adopted a modified procedure wherein the semitendinosus and gracilis are transferred above the knee joint, along with lengthening of the semimembranosus and biceps femoris. PURPOSE: The purpose of our study is to evaluate the differences between hamstring lengthening alone (HSL group) and hamstring lengthening plus transfer (HST group) in the treatment of flexed knee gait in ambulatory children with CP. We hypothesized that recurrence of increased knee flexion in the stance phase will be less in the HST group at long-term follow-up, and hip extensor power will be better preserved. METHODS: Fifty children with CP who underwent hamstring surgery for flexed knee gait were retrospectively reviewed. All subjects underwent a pre-operative gait study, a follow-up post-operative gait study, and a long-term gait study. The subjects were divided into two groups; HSL group (18 subjects) or HST group (32 subjects). The mean age at surgery was 9.9 ± 3.3 years. The mean follow-up time was 4.4 ± 0.9 (2.7-6.3) years. RESULTS: On physical examination, both groups showed improvement in straight leg raise, knee extension, popliteal angle, and maximum knee extension in stance at the first post-op study, and maintained this improvement at the long-term follow-up, with the exception of straight leg raise, which slightly worsened in both groups at the final follow-up. Both groups improved maximum knee extension in stance at the initial follow-up, and maintained this at the long-term follow-up. Only the HST group showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the peak hip extension power in stance at the first post-op study, and this increased further at the final follow-up. In the HSL group, there was an initial slight decrease in the hip extension power, which subsequently increased to pre-operative values at the long-term study. Only the HST group showed increase of the average anterior pelvic tilt at the long-term follow-up study, although this was small in magnitude. There were two subjects who developed knee recurvatum at the post-op study, and both were in the HST group. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear benefit in regards to recurrence when comparing HST to HSL in the long term. In both HSL and HST, there was reduction of stance phase knee flexion in the long term, with no clear advantage in either group. Longer follow-up is needed for additional recurrence information. There was greater improvement of hip extension power in the HST group, which may justify the additional operative time of the transfer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study helps pediatric orthopedic surgeons choose between two different techniques to treat flexed knee gait in patients with CP by showing the long-term outcome of both procedures.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of children's orthopaedics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Follow-Up Studies","uri":{"id":"D005500","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cerebral Palsy","uri":{"id":"D002547","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Follow-Up Studies","uri":{"id":"D005500","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knee Joint","uri":{"id":"D007719","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physical Examination","uri":{"id":"D010808","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Operative Time","uri":{"id":"D061646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ankle","uri":{"id":"D000842","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Contracture","uri":{"id":"D003286","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Orthopedics","uri":{"id":"D009985","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Paralysis","uri":{"id":"D010243","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430874","title":"Comparison of hamstring transfer with hamstring lengthening in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy: further follow-up.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: A body shape index (ABSI) has been proposed as a possible improvement over waist circumference (WC) as a marker of abdominal adiposity because it removes the correlation of WC with body mass index (BMI) and with height. We assessed the association of ABSI with four obesity-related cancers compared to that of other anthropometric measures of adiposity. METHODS: We used data from the Women's Health Initiative, a large cohort of postmenopausal women, recruited between 1993 and 1998 and followed until September 2013, to assess the associations of ABSI and other anthropometric measures with risk of cancers of the breast, endometrium, colorectum, and kidney. The four comparison anthropometric measures were BMI, WC, waist circumference-to-height ratio (WHtR), and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Over a median of 12.7 years of follow-up, among 143,901 women, we identified 7,039 invasive breast cancers, 1,157 endometrial cancers, 1,908 colorectal cancers, and 376 kidney cancers. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association of quintiles of the five measures with risk of the four cancers. RESULTS: Unlike the other anthropometric indices, ABSI was not associated with increased risk of breast or endometrial cancer. BMI and WC were comparable as predictors of breast and endometrial cancer, and these associations were unchanged after mutual adjustment. For colorectal and kidney cancers, ABSI was a significant predictor comparable to BMI; however, WC showed the strongest association with colorectal cancer, and WC, WHtR, and WHR all showed stronger associations with kidney cancer. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other anthropometric measures, ABSI showed no association with risk of breast or endometrial cancer and was more weakly associated with risk of colorectal and kidney cancers compared to more established measures of central adiposity.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer causes & control : CCC","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kidney Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D007680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Endometrial Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D016889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kidney Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D007680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Body Mass Index","uri":{"id":"D015992","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proportional Hazards Models","uri":{"id":"D016016","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Endometrial Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D016889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Waist Circumference","uri":{"id":"D055105","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women's Health","uri":{"id":"D016387","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Waist-Hip Ratio","uri":{"id":"D049629","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Endometrium","uri":{"id":"D004717","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Kidney","uri":{"id":"D007668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Symbiosis","uri":{"id":"D013559","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Postmenopause","uri":{"id":"D017698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adiposity","uri":{"id":"D050154","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430815","title":"Risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, and renal cancers in postmenopausal women in association with a body shape index and other anthropometric measures.","year":"2014"}

Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other clinical characteristics.MethodsThis prospective observation study included 75 NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36 years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis. All subjects underwent BMD assessment by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), duodenal histology, HLA DQ typing, body mass index (BMI) evaluation and assessment for daily calcium intake.ResultsDBPC CMP challenge showed that 30 of the 75 NCWS patients suffered from multiple food sensitivity. Osteopenia and osteoporosis frequency increased from IBS to NCWS and to celiac disease (CD) (P <0.0001). Thirty-five NCWS patients (46.6%) showed osteopenia or osteoporosis. Low BMD was related to low BMI and multiple food sensitivity. Values of daily dietary calcium intake in NCWS patients were significantly lower than in IBS controls.ConclusionsAn elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients was found; this was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with NCWS associated with other food sensitivity.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: ● To evaluate clinical and radiographic predictors of need for partial or circumferential resection of the inferior vena cava (IVC-R) requiring complex vascular reconstruction during venous tumor thrombectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: ● Data were collected regarding 172 patients with RCC and IVC (level I-IV) venous tumor thrombus who underwent radical nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 2000 and 2010. ● Preoperative imaging was re-reviewed by one of two radiologists blinded to details of the patient's surgical procedure. ● Univariable and multivariable associations of clinical and radiographic features with IVC-R were evaluated by logistic regression. ● Secondary analysis assessed the ability of the model to predict histologic invasion of the IVC by the tumor thrombus. RESULTS: ● Of the 172 patients, 38 (22%) underwent IVC-R procedures during nephrectomy. ● Optimal radiographic cut-points determined to predict need for IVC-R based on preoperative imaging included a renal vein (RV) diameter at the RV ostium (RVo) of 15.5 mm, maximal AP diameter of the IVC of 34.0 mm and AP and coronal diameters of the IVC at the RVo of 24 mm and 19 mm respectively. ● On multivariable analysis, the presence of a right-sided tumor (OR 3.3; p=0.017), AP diameter of the IVC at the RVo ≥ 24.0 mm (OR 4.4; p=0.017), and radiographic identification of complete occlusion of the IVC at the RVo (OR 4.9; p<0.001) were associated with a significantly increased risk of IVC-R. The c-index for the model was 0.81. CONCLUSIONS: ● We present a multivariable model of radiographic features associated with the need for IVC-R during tumor thrombectomy ● Pending external validation, this model may be used for preoperative planning, patient counseling, and planned involvement of vascular surgical colleagues in anticipation of need for complex vascular repair.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BJU international","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Renal Cell","uri":{"id":"D002292","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Renal Veins","uri":{"id":"D012082","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vena Cava, Inferior","uri":{"id":"D014682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coroners and Medical Examiners","uri":{"id":"D003334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nephrectomy","uri":{"id":"D009392","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thrombosis","uri":{"id":"D013927","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Venae Cavae","uri":{"id":"D014684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thrombectomy","uri":{"id":"D017131","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430786","title":"Clinical and Radiographic Predictors of the Need for Inferior Vena Caval Resection during Nephrectomy for Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma and Caval Tumor Thrombus.","year":"2014"}

It depicts the national infrastructure, methods and partners in patient safety work as well as the development in key areas. Since 2000, the interest in patient safety and quality issues has significantly increased. A national study (2009) showed that more than 100,000 patients (8.6 %) experienced preventable harm in hospitals. Since 2007, all Swedish counties and regions work on the \"National commitment for increased patient safety\" to systematically minimize adverse events in the healthcare system. Also, a national strategy for patient safety has been proposed based on a new law regulating the responsibility for patient safety (2011) and a zero vision in terms of preventable harm and adverse events. The Nordic collaboration in this field currently focuses on the development of indicators and quality measurement with respect to nosocomial infections, harm in inpatient somatic care, patient safety culture, hospital mortality and polypharmacy in the elderly. The Nordic collaboration is driven by the development, exchange and documentation of experiences and evidence on patient safety indicators. The work presented in this article is only a part of the Swedish and the Nordic efforts related to patient safety and provides an interesting insight into how this work can be carried out.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Indicators, Health Care","uri":{"id":"D019984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Care","uri":{"id":"D005791","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospital Mortality","uri":{"id":"D017052","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Safety","uri":{"id":"D061214","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross Infection","uri":{"id":"D003428","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cooperative Behavior","uri":{"id":"D003299","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Indicators and Reagents","uri":{"id":"D007202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inpatients","uri":{"id":"D007297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sweden","uri":{"id":"D013548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Cessation Products","uri":{"id":"D061485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Documentation","uri":{"id":"D004282","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polypharmacy","uri":{"id":"D019338","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430735","title":"[Patient safety in Sweden.]","year":"2014"}

To understand circadian disfunction in the age-related neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD), the rotenone-induced PD (RIPD) male Wistar rat model was used. The alterations in the rhythmic dynamic equilibrium of interactions between the various components of serotonin metabolism and the molecular clock were measured. There was significant decrease in the mean 24 h levels of tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), serotonin (5-HT), N-acetyl serotonin (NAS) and melatonin (MEL) by approximately 63, 51, 76 and 96 % respectively ( p ≤ 0.05). However significant increase in 5-methoxy indole acetic acid (5-MIAA), 5-methoxy tryptophol (5-MTOH), 5-hydroxy tryptophol (5-HTOH) indicated increased serotonin catabolism with the abolition of daily rhythms of MEL, 5-HTP and 5-MIAA in RIPD. 24 h mean levels of rPer1, rCry1, rBmal1 reduced by about 0.5, 0.74 and 0.39-fold and increased for rPer2 by about 1.7-fold. The daily pulse of rPer2, rCry1, rCry2 and rBmal1 significantly decreased by 0.36, 0.6, 0.14, 0.1 and 0.2-fold. As melatonin, an antioxidant and an endogenous synchronizer of rhythm declined in RIPD male Wistar rat model, the effects of melatonin-administration on the rhythmic expression of various clock genes were studied. Interestingly, melatonin-administration resulted in restoration of the phase of rPer1 daily rhythm in RIPD indicating differential sensitivity of various clock components towards melatonin. The animals which were administered both rotenone and MEL for 48 days interestingly showed neuroprotective effects in dark phase on correlations between expression of various genes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biogerontology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rats, Wistar","uri":{"id":"D017208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neuroprotective Agents","uri":{"id":"D018696","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","uri":{"id":"D019636","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetates","uri":{"id":"D000085","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parkinson Disease","uri":{"id":"D010300","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suprachiasmatic Nucleus","uri":{"id":"D013493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetic Acid","uri":{"id":"D019342","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetals","uri":{"id":"D000080","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetates","uri":{"id":"D000085","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antioxidants","uri":{"id":"D000975","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Periodicity","uri":{"id":"D010507","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pulse","uri":{"id":"D011674","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serotonin","uri":{"id":"D012701","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"5-Hydroxytryptophan","uri":{"id":"D006916","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Indoles","uri":{"id":"D007211","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Melatonin","uri":{"id":"D008550","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rotenone","uri":{"id":"D012402","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tryptophan","uri":{"id":"D014364","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430725","title":"Daily rhythms of serotonin metabolism and the expression of clock genes in suprachiasmatic nucleus of rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease male Wistar rat model and effect of melatonin administration.","year":"2014"}

The study aimed to examine the cause of hypobetalipoproteinemia in two patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) is a study demonstrating that intensive blood glucose control delays the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes complications. Hypobetalipoproteinemia was present in two DCCT subjects, IDs 1427 and 1078, whose LDL-C levels were 36 and 28 mg/dL, respectively, and triglyceride levels were 20 and 28 mg/dL, respectively. We performed exome sequencing on genomic DNA from the two patients with hypobetalipoproteinemia. RESULTS: The subjects 1427 and 1078 had heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and these mutations resulted in premature stop codons at amino acid 1333 (ApoB-29) and 3680 (ApoB-81), respectively. Indeed, the plasma ApoB level of subject 1427 (19 mg/dL) was the lowest and that of subject 1078 (26 mg/dL) was the second to the lowest among all the 1,441 DCCT participants. Sequencing genomic DNA of family members showed that probands 1427 and 1078 inherited the mutations from the father and the mother, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of ApoB loss-of-function mutations in type 1 diabetic patients presents innovative cases to study the interaction between hypobetalipoproteinemia and insulin

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification, a regulated process in chronic kidney disease (CKD), requires vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation into osteoblast-like cells. This phenomenon can be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CKD rats with vascular calcification, we investigated whether inflammatory cytokines, ROS generation, and downstream signaling events are associated with CKD-related vascular calcification. METHODS: CKD was induced in male Wistar rats by renal mass ablation and vascular calcification was induced with a high calcium-phosphate diet and vitamin D supplementation (Ca/P/VitD). At week 3-6, hemodynamic parameters were determined and thoracic aorta was harvested for assessment of vascular calcification, macrophage infiltration, cytokines expression, VSMC differentiation, ROS generation, and related signaling pathway activation. RESULTS: CKD rats treated with Ca/P/VitD developed medial calcification of thoracic aorta and increased pulse pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity. VSMC differentiation was confirmed by increased bone morphogenetic protein-2 and osteocalcin expression and reduced α-smooth muscle actin expression. The expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor were also increased. The expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits p22(phox) and p47(phox) were increased, whereas the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, Gpx1, and Prdx1) was reduced in CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats. Oxidized peroxiredoxin, a sensor of ROS generation, was significantly increased and ROS-sensitive signaling pathways were activated in the aorta from CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a relationship between inflammation/ROS and arterial calcification in CKD and contributes to understanding of the complex pathways that mediate arterial calcification in CKD patients.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"American journal of

In this study, the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation dormancy onset date (DOD) and its climate controls over temperate China were examined by analysing the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index and concurrent climate data from 1982 to 2010. Results show that preseason (May through October) air temperature is the primary climatic control of the DOD spatial pattern across temperate China, whereas preseason cumulative precipitation is dominantly associated with the DOD spatial pattern in relatively cold regions. Temporally, the average DOD over China's temperate ecosystems has delayed by 0.13 days per year during the past three decades. However, the delay trends are not continuous throughout the 29-year period. The DOD experienced the largest delay during the 1980s, but the delay trend slowed down or even reversed during the 1990s and 2000s. Our results also show that interannual variations in DOD are most significantly related with preseason mean temperature in most ecosystems, except for the desert ecosystem for which the variations in DOD are mainly regulated by preseason cumulative precipitation. Moreover, temperature also determines the spatial pattern of temperature sensitivity of DOD, which became significantly lower as temperature increased. On the other hand, the temperature sensitivity of DOD increases with increasing precipitation, especially in relatively dry areas (e.g. temperate grassland). This finding stresses the importance of hydrological control on the response of autumn phenology to changes in temperature, which must be accounted in current temperature-driven phenological models.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Global change biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Air Conditioning","uri":{"id":"D000389","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Climate Change","uri":{"id":"D057231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"China","uri":{"id":"D002681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Climate","uri":{"id":"D002980","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temperance","uri":{"id":"D013695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temperature","uri":{"id":"D013696","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vegetables","uri":{"id":"D014675","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ecosystem","uri":{"id":"D017753","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430658","title":"Changes in autumn vegetation dormancy onset date and the climate controls across temperate ecosystems in China from 1982 to 2010.","year":"2014"}

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) was conducted to determine the effects of the DASH diet on cardiovascular risk factors. Medline, Embase and Scopus databases were searched from inception to December 2013. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) DASH diet; (2) RCT; (3) risk factors including systolic and diastolic BP and glucose, HDL, LDL, TAG and total cholesterol concentrations; (4) control group. Random-effects models were used to determine the pooled effect sizes. Meta-regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between effect sizes, baseline values of the risk factors, BMI, age, quality of trials, salt intake and study duration. A total of twenty articles reporting data for 1917 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The duration of interventions ranged from 2 to 24 weeks. The DASH diet was found to result in significant decreases in systolic BP ( - 5·2 mmHg, 95 % CI - 7·0, - 3·4; P< 0·001) and diastolic BP ( - 2·6 mmHg, 95 % CI - 3·5, - 1·7; P< 0·001) and in the concentrations of total cholesterol ( - 0·20 mmol/l, 95 % CI - 0·31, - 0·10; P< 0·001) and LDL ( - 0·10 mmol/l, 95 % CI - 0·20, - 0·01; P= 0·03). Changes in both systolic and diastolic BP were greater in participants with higher baseline BP or BMI. These changes predicted a reduction of approximately 13 % in the 10-year Framingham risk score for CVD. The DASH diet improved cardiovascular risk factors and appeared to have greater beneficial effects in subjects with an increased cardiometabolic risk.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: The current focus on a physically active lifestyle in children puts children at increased physical activity-related injury risk. OBJECTIVE: To summarise, in a systematic review, the evidence for the injury risk of several physical activity behaviours in 6- to 12-year-old children. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in three databases (Embase, PubMed and SPORTDiscus). Inclusion criteria were: age 6-12 years; report on injuries related to overall physical activity, active commuting, unorganised leisure time physical activity, physical education and/or organised sports; incidence rates expressed as injuries per hours of physical activity; and published after January 1st 2000. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies included. RESULTS: Eight studies were included. The risk of bias assessment resulted in two studies with a score that was higher than 75 %; risk bias of those two studies was considered low. The medically treated, injury incidence rate was reported to be between 0.15 and 0.27 injuries per 1,000 h of physical activity. The absolute number of injuries related to unorganised leisure time physical activity was higher than the absolute number of injuries reported in organised sports. The respective injury incidence rate expressed per 1,000 h exposure was, however, generally lower during unorganised leisure time than during organised sports. Reported injury incidence rates related to active commuting were comparable to those for unorganised leisure time physical activity. Conflicting injury incidence rates were reported for physical education. Subgroup analysis suggested that girls and children with low habitual levels of physical activity are at increased injury risk.

The purpose of this study was to assess the dietary habits in a group of adolescent girls with PCOS. Adolescents with PCOS were recruited and asked to complete a questionnaire on their eating habits and a recall dietary diary, from which their caloric and macronutrient intake was calculated. Results were compared with those from a group of normal controls. Thirty-five women with PCOS and 46 controls were included. Girls with PCOS were less likely to have cereals for breakfast (20.7 versus 66.7%) and as a result consumed less fibre than controls. They were more likely to eat an evening meal (97.1 versus 78.3%) and eat this over an hour later when compared to controls. Despite having comparable body mass indexes, girls with PCOS ate a daily surplus calorie average of 3% versus controls that had a negative calorie intake of 0.72% (p = 0.047). Ameliorating eating habits early in adolescence in girls with PCOS may improve future metabolic concerns related to a genetic predisposition and worsened by an unhealthy lifestyle.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Food Habits","uri":{"id":"D005510","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Weight Gain","uri":{"id":"D015430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Body Mass Index","uri":{"id":"D015992","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Predisposition to Disease","uri":{"id":"D020022","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D011085","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sedentary Lifestyle","uri":{"id":"D057185","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cereals","uri":{"id":"D002523","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eating","uri":{"id":"D004435","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life Style","uri":{"id":"D008019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D013577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carbohydrates","uri":{"id":"D002241","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Meals","uri":{"id":"D062407","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breakfast","uri":{"id":"D062408","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430596","title":"Dietary habits in adolescent girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome.","year":"2014"}

Historically, LCH has been presumed to arise from transformed or pathologically activated epidermal dendritic cells called Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the ERK signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology. Based on these findings, we propose that LCH should be re-defined as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia. Increased understanding of LCH pathogenesis will provide opportunities to optimize and personalize therapy through improved risk-stratification, targeted therapy and assessment of therapy response based on specific molecular features and origin of the pathological myeloid cells.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"British journal of haematology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Langerhans Cells","uri":{"id":"D007801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Critical Pathways","uri":{"id":"D019091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"MAP Kinase Signaling System","uri":{"id":"D020935","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myeloid Cells","uri":{"id":"D022423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myeloid Cells","uri":{"id":"D022423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dendritic Cells","uri":{"id":"D003713","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell","uri":{"id":"D006646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Langerhans Cells","uri":{"id":"D007801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dendrites","uri":{"id":"D003712","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histiocytes","uri":{"id":"D006644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathology","uri":{"id":"D010336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histiocytosis","uri":{"id":"D015614","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phagocytes","uri":{"id":"D010586","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430560","title":"Progress in understanding the pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: back to Histiocytosis X?","year":"2014"}

Six minute walk distance (6MWD) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as assessed by short form 36 scores (SF-36) also impact clinical outcomes in these patients. This study explored the relationship between the sarcopenia, 6MWD, and HRQOL in LT candidates. Sarcopenia was evaluated based on skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) quantified from abdominal computed tomography. Patients were followed until death, removal from the wait list or the end of the study period. Two hundred and thirteen patients listed for LT were included. The mean SMI, 6MWD and mean gait speed were 54.3 ± 9.7, 370.5 m and 1 m/s respectively. Sarcopenia was noted in 22.2% of LT candidates. There was no correlation between sarcopenia, 6MWD and SF-36 scores. The 6MWD, but not sarcopenia, was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio = 2.1 (0.9-4.7). In summary, sarcopenia did not emerge as a significant predictor of waitlist mortality and also failed to correlate with either functional capacity or HRQOL in LT candidates.

This was a case-control study that evaluated 40 women with PCOS and 40 controls. Androgens and insulin resistance were measured. BC was based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Isometric handgrip and maximal dynamic muscle strength (1-RM) strength tests were performed. Median total testosterone (p < 0.01), free androgen index (p < 0.01), insulin (p < 0.01) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (p = 0.02) were higher and sex hormone binding globulin (SBHG) (p = 0.04) was lower in the PCOS group. Normoweight women with PCOS had higher percentages of android body fat. However, the prevalence of android fat distribution was higher in the PCOS than in the control group (p = 0.04). The strength 1-RM in bench press (p < 0.01), muscle strength relative to lean muscle mass in the dominant lower limb (p = 0.04) and isometric handgrip strength tests (p = 0.03) was higher in the PCOS group. PCOS was a determinant of strength in the bench press exercise (p = 0.04). The hyperandrogenism was a predictor of increased strength in biceps curl exercises (p = 0.03) in the dominant lower limb (p = 0.02) and isometric handgrip strength (p = 0.03). In conclusion, women with PCOS have greater muscle strength and a higher prevalence of central obesity, but no difference in BC.

Egocentric network interviews were conducted with 175 diverse YMSM who described 837 sex partners within 167 sexual-active egos. Sexual partner alter attributes were summarized by ego. Descriptives of ego demographics, sexual partner demographics, and network characteristics were calculated by race of the ego and compared. No racial differences were found in individual engagement in HIV risk behaviors or concurrent sexual partnership. Racial differences were found in partner characteristics, including female gender, non-gay sexual orientations, older age, and residence in a high HIV prevalence neighborhood. Racial differences in relationship characteristics included type of relationships (i.e., main partner) and strength of relationships. Network characteristics also showed differences, including sexual network density and assortativity by race. Most racial differences were in the direction of effects that would tend to increase HIV incidence among Black YMSM.

Although this pattern of increased reactivity has been established for the somatosensory modality, its generalization to other sensory modalities remains controversial. METHODS: Auditory evoked potentials were obtained using a paired-stimuli paradigm from a sample of 52 FM female patients and 55 healthy women matched for age and socio-economic status. Sensory gating of the P50 component, as indicated by P50 suppression rates to the second identical stimuli, was analysed in relation to clinical indices of FM, including algometry of tender points and a number of self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: Sensory gating mechanisms in FM patients proved to be normal, robust and as efficient as those recorded in control subjects. There was no correlation between P50 suppression rates and indices of clinical or experimental (threshold or tolerance) pain. In addition, P50 sensory gating was not related to the other main symptoms of FM, including fatigue, sleep dysfunction or co-morbid depression, nor to hypersensitivity to noise or headache. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that FM patients do not present significant deficits in early sensory gating when processing auditory stimuli, and therefore challenge the 'generalized hypersensitivity' hypothesis of FM.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of pain (London, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forms and Records Control","uri":{"id":"D005568","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evoked Potentials","uri":{"id":"D005071","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evoked Potentials, Auditory","uri":{"id":"D005072","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Class","uri":{"id":"D012923","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensory Gating","uri":{"id":"D055139","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fatigue","uri":{"id":"D005221","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypersensitivity","uri":{"id":"D006967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Noise","uri":{"id":"D009622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comorbidity","uri":{"id":"D015897","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fibromyalgia","uri":{"id":"D005356","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Generalization (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D005793","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache","uri":{"id":"D006261","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430500","title":"Filtering out repetitive auditory stimuli in fibromyalgia: A study of P50 sensory gating.","year":"2014"}

However, there is no pharmacological therapy available for promoting recovery. Although treatment of stroke with cystamine has gained increasing interest, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Thus, our aim is to examine the effect of cystamine on the function recovery after stroke and investigate further cystamine mechanisms. METHODS: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to photothrombotic model of focal stroke or sham operation. Cystamine or saline was administered intraperitoneally at 24 h after stroke. Functional recovery was analyzed using behavioral tests; axon remodeling was analyzed using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and histological assessment. ANA-12, an antagonist of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), was administrated to examine the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection mediated by cystamine. RESULTS: Treatment with cystamine resulted in amelioration of impaired function with concomitant enhancement of axonal remodeling. Cystamine treatment significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and phosphorylation of TrkB in brain after stroke. Cystamine significantly enhanced neuronal progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal survival, and plasticity through BDNF/TrkB pathway.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: It has found that ischemic postconditioning (IPO) might decrease pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which is one of the main reasons of lung injury caused by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). It was found that aquaporins (AQPs) play a role in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis. But it is still unclear whether IPO influences the expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1). This study was designed to investigate whether IPO can reduce CPB-related lung injury and affect the expression of AQP1 of lungs. METHODS: Twelve healthy dogs were divided into control group (C group) and ischemia postconditioning group (IPO group). CPB procedures were implemented. Ten minutes later, the left pulmonary artery was separated and blocked. Postconditioning consisted of two cycles of 5-minute pulmonary artery reperfusion/5-minute reocclusion starting at the beginning of reperfusion. The 2×4 cm tissues of both sides of pulmonary apex, superior, middle and inferior lobe were taken before CPB (T1), before occlusion and reopening of left pulmonary artery (T2, T3), and 2 hours after CPB (T4). Samples were used to evaluate lung injury degrees and to detect the expression of AQP1. At T1 and T4, blood was collected from femoral artery to calculate pulmonary function. RESULTS: At T4, each pulmonary function showed significant deterioration compared with T1. Lung injury could be found at the onset of CPB. However, the expression of AQP1 decreased and wet to dry weight ratio (W/D) increased after T2. In the left lung of C group, the worst pulmonary function and structures were detected. The slightest changes were discovered in the right lung of C group. A close relationship between W/D and lung injury score was found. The lung injury score was negatively related with the expression of AQP1. It was found that the expression of AQP1 was negatively connected with W/D. CONCLUSIONS: In dog CPB models, lung injury induced by CPB was related with down regulated expression of AQP1. AQP1 is believed to be involved in the mechanisms of lung ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury caused by CPB. IPO increases the expression of AQP1, provides a protective effect on lung suffering from CPB, and alleviates CPB-related lung injury.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Chinese medical journal","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiopulmonary Bypass","uri":{"id":"D002315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Femoral Artery","uri":{"id":"D005263","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pulmonary Artery","uri":{"id":"D011651","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung Injury","uri":{"id":"D055370","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ischemic Postconditioning","uri":{"id":"D057775","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arteries","uri":{"id":"D001158","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Homeostasis","uri":{"id":"D006706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ischemia","uri":{"id":"D007511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung","uri":{"id":"D008168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maintenance","uri":{"id":"D008283","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Psychological","uri":{"id":"D013315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reperfusion","uri":{"id":"D015424","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aquaporins","uri":{"id":"D020346","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430441","title":"Ischemic postconditioning alleviates lung injury and maintains a better expression of aquaporin-1 during cardiopulmonary bypass.","year":"2014"}

(HL) exerts antioxidant activities against various oxidative stress conditions. In this study, we investigated effects of extract from HL leaves (HLE) on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) of aged gerbils. METHODS: Aged gerbils (24 months) were divided into vehicle (saline)-treated- and HLE-treated-groups. The vehicle and HLE were orally administered with 200 mg/kg once a day for 20 days before sacrifice. Cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation were examined in the DG using Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX), respectively. We also observed changes in immunoreactivities of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (p-GSK-3β) to examine their relation with neurogenesis using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The administration of HLE significantly increased the number of Ki67-positive cells and DCX-positive neuroblasts with well-developed processes in the SGZ of the DG of the HLE-treated-group. In addition, immunoreactivities of SOD1, SOD2, BDNF, and p-GSK-3β were significantly increased in granule and polymorphic cells of the DG in the HLE-treated-group compared with those in the vehicle-treated-group. CONCLUSIONS: HLE treatment significantly increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, showing that immunoreactivities of SOD1, SOD2, BDNF, and p-GSK-3β were significantly increased in the DG. These indicate that increased neuroblast differentiation neurogenesis may be closely related to upregulation of SOD1, SOD2, BDNF, and p-GSK-3β in aged gerbils.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Chinese medical journal","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Extracts","uri":{"id":"D002457","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nerve Growth Factors","uri":{"id":"D009414","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Superoxide Dismutase","uri":{"id":"D013482","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidative Stress","uri":{"id":"D018384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor","uri":{"id":"D019208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intrinsic Factor","uri":{"id":"D007437","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dentate Gyrus","uri":{"id":"D018891","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antioxidants","uri":{"id":"D000975","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxides","uri":{"id":"D010087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Superoxides","uri":{"id":"D013481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor","uri":{"id":"D019208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Salinity","uri":{"id":"D054712","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gerbillinae","uri":{"id":"D005849","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hippophae","uri":{"id":"D031281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurogenesis","uri":{"id":"D055495","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430440","title":"Hippophae rhamnoides L. leaves extract enhances cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation through upregulation of intrinsic factors in the dentate gyrus of the aged gerbil.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a novel inflammatory marker that is released from neutrophils. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between serum NGAL level and clinical and angiographic risk scores in patients diagnosed with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). METHODS: Forty-seven random NSTE-ACS patients and 45 patients with normal coronary arteries (NCA) who underwent coronary angiography were enrolled in the study. GRACE risk score and SYNTAX and Gensini risk scores were used, respectively, for the purpose of clinical risk assessment and angiographic risk scoring. Serum NGAL level was measured via ELISA in peripheral blood samples obtained from the patients at the time of admission. RESULTS: Serum NGAL level was significantly higher in the NSTE-ACS group compared to the control group (112.3±49.6 ng/mL vs. 58.1±24.3 ng/mL, p<0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between serum NGAL levels and the GRACE (r=0.533 and p<0.001), SYNTAX (r=0.395 and p=0.006), and Gensini risk scores (r=0.575 and p<0.001). The intermediate-high SYNTAX (>22) group had statistically significantly higher serum NGAL levels compared to the low SYNTAX (≤22) group (143±29.5 ng/mL vs. 98.7±43.2 ng/mL, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: NGAL level was positively correlated with lesion complexity and severity of coronary artery disease in patients with NSTE-ACS. Serum NGAL levels on admission are associated with increased burden of atherosclerosis in patients with NSTE-ACS.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Anadolu kardiyoloji dergisi : AKD = the Anatolian journal of cardiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Disease","uri":{"id":"D003327","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Assessment","uri":{"id":"D018570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Artery Disease","uri":{"id":"D003324","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Vessels","uri":{"id":"D003331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coronary Angiography","uri":{"id":"D017023","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acute Coronary Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D054058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Angiography","uri":{"id":"D000792","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arteries","uri":{"id":"D001158","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","uri":{"id":"D004797","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D013577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atherosclerosis","uri":{"id":"D050197","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neutrophils","uri":{"id":"D009504","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lipocalins","uri":{"id":"D054834","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430410","title":"Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels are correlated with the complexity and the severity of atherosclerosis in acute coronary syndrome.","year":"2014"}

We aimed to assess the frequency and impact of dysnatraemias in the inpatient (INPT) and outpatient (OPT) setting in desmopressin-treated CDI, comparing those with normal thirst to those with abnormal thirst. Design: 192 patients with cranial diabetes were identified from the Beaumont Pituitary Database, a tertiary referral centre. Retrospective case note audit was performed and the clinical and biochemical information of 147 patients with CDI were available for analysis. Results: 4142 plasma sodium measurements for 137 patients with normal thirst, and 385 plasma sodium measurements for 10 patients with abnormal thirst were analysed. In those with normal thirst the most common OPT abnormality was mild hyponatremia (pNa+ 131-134mmol/l) in 27%, while 14.6% had more significant hyponatraemia (pNa+ <130mmol/l). 5.8% of patients with normal thirst were admitted due to complications directly related to hyponatraemia. Compared to patients with normal thirst, those with abnormal thirst were more likely to develop significant OPT hypernatraemia (20% v 1.4%, p0.02) and significant INPT hyponatraemia (50% v 11.1%, p0.02). Conclusion: Outpatient management of CDI is complicated by a significant incidence of hyponatraemia. In contrast, OPT hypernatraemia is almost exclusively a complication seen in adipsic CDI, who also had more frequent in-patient hyponatraemia. CDI associated with thirst disorder requires increased physician attention and patient awareness of potential complications.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of endocrinology / European Federation of Endocrine Societies","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Administration, Intravenous","uri":{"id":"D061605","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retrospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D012189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diabetes Insipidus","uri":{"id":"D003919","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Awareness","uri":{"id":"D001364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inpatients","uri":{"id":"D007297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outpatients","uri":{"id":"D010045","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sodium","uri":{"id":"D012964","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deamino Arginine Vasopressin","uri":{"id":"D003894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyponatremia","uri":{"id":"D007010","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thirst","uri":{"id":"D013894","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430399","title":"Abnormal plasma sodium concentrations in patients treated with desmopressin for cranial diabetes insipidus: results of a long term retrospective study.","year":"2014"}

Recently, research has focused on stress hormones, with cortisol being the most widely researched, during the prodromal phase of psychosis. Thus, the present study aims to systematically review the evidence concerning the role of cortisol in At Risk for Psychosis mental state and its associations with psychopathological correlates. We systematically reviewed the literature referring to both At Clinical Risk for Psychosis and At Genetic Risk for Psychosis mental state. Sixteen studies were identified. A trend towards increased cortisol levels in saliva emerged. Findings concerning cortisol levels in the blood were minimal and less consistent. The longitudinal studies, though with divergent results, hinted towards upregulation of cortisol secretion prior to psychotic conversion. Regarding cortisol's reactivity, evaluated through neuroendocrine, psychosocial and naturalistic stressors, the findings were minimal and divergent. The hypothesized relation of psychotic symptomatology with cortisol in At Risk for Psychosis subjects was not confirmed by the majority of the studies. On the contrary, the anxiety parameter and stress intolerance index were both positively associated with cortisol. In conclusion, the literature related to the evaluation of cortisol levels/function at prodrome is hitherto minimal. Although the evidence favors cortisol's participation in the pathophysiology of psychosis the exact cause effect sequence and the intertwining of cortisol with psychopathology are yet unclear.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hormones","uri":{"id":"D006728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrocortisone","uri":{"id":"D006854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotic Disorders","uri":{"id":"D011618","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saliva","uri":{"id":"D012463","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Schizophrenia","uri":{"id":"D012559","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychopathology","uri":{"id":"D011599","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430397","title":"The role of cortisol in At Risk for Psychosis mental state and psychopathological correlates: a systematic review.","year":"2014"}

The method employs a commonly available Pasteur pipette which is tightly packed with silica gel and anhydrous sodium sulfate. Clean-up and detection of illegal levels can be achieved on the same column. Viewing the developed MC under a UV lamp revealed that TCs can be detected as a compact golden yellow fluorescent band at the junction between the anhydrous sodium sulfate and silica gel layers. Comparing the yellow band of control extracts with those fortified (100 ng mL(-1)) showed no overlap between analyte and impurities. The limit of detection (LOD) of the MC assay was 1 ng, indicating that chicken sample containing 10 µg TCs kg(-1) sample could be easily detected. Moreover, the intensity of the yellow band increased whenever TCs level in the extract increased. Evaluation utility of the method with blind samples as controls or samples fortified with total TCs at various levels indicated that about 90% of the total blank and spiked samples at levels below the permissible limits were assessed as accepted.

Alterations in digestive traits such as gut morphology and physiology may enable these niche shifts and affect the persistence of populations and species. Relatively few studies, however, have assessed how niche shifts influence suites of digestive traits through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary mechanisms, and how these trait changes can subsequently alter the nutrition, fitness and life history of organisms. We investigated how population divergence and plasticity alter the gut physiology of wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), assessing whether variation in digestive traits correspond with enhanced nutrient assimilation under a pronounced dietary shift. We examined gut enzyme activity, and gut size and mass of wild guppies from both high-predation (HP) and low-predation (LP) habitats when reared in the laboratory and fed on high- or low-quality diets designed to reflect their dietary differences previously found in nature. After 10 weeks on the experimental diets, HP guppies maintained shorter and lighter guts than LP guppies on either diet. Guppies also differed in their digestive enzymatic profiles, more often reflecting nutrient balancing so that increased enzyme expression tended to correspond with more deficient nutrients in the diet. LP guppies had increased somatic phosphorus at the end of the experiment, possibly related to the higher alkaline phosphatase activity in their guts. Our results suggest that differences in gut physiology exist among populations of Trinidadian guppies that may reflect local adaptation to their disparate environments.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Oecologia","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Body Composition","uri":{"id":"D001823","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alkaline Phosphatase","uri":{"id":"D000469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Activation","uri":{"id":"D004789","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Activators","uri":{"id":"D020536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Food","uri":{"id":"D005502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Laboratories","uri":{"id":"D007753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases","uri":{"id":"D010744","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphorus","uri":{"id":"D010758","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physiology","uri":{"id":"D010827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plastics","uri":{"id":"D010969","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ecosystem","uri":{"id":"D017753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poecilia","uri":{"id":"D011036","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430044","title":"Changes in digestive traits and body nutritional composition accommodate a trophic niche shift in Trinidadian guppies.","year":"2014"}

In the additive model, the risk of GD decreased significantly as the number of T alleles increased in females [odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 (0.50-0.90), P = 0.007]. The multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent contribution of rs179010 to the protective effect against GD. This study indicates that rs179010 in TLR7 may be associated with the decreased susceptibility to GD in Chinese Cantonese.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Tissue antigens","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Regression Analysis","uri":{"id":"D012044","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Odds Ratio","uri":{"id":"D016017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Autoimmune Diseases","uri":{"id":"D001327","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Graves Disease","uri":{"id":"D006111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Toll-Like Receptors","uri":{"id":"D051193","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Toll-Like Receptor 7","uri":{"id":"D051199","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adaptive Immunity","uri":{"id":"D056704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Autoimmunity","uri":{"id":"D015551","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Freezing","uri":{"id":"D005615","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430040","title":"Association of Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 gene polymorphisms with Graves' disease in Chinese Cantonese population.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study the cancer stem cell populations in esophageal cancer cell lines KYSE150 and TE1 and identify whether resulting stem-like cell spheres display radiation resistance characteristics. METHODS: Serum-free medium (SFM) suspension was used to culture the esophageal cancer stem cell lines and enrich the esophageal stem-like cell spheres. RT-PCR assay was used to detect the stem cell gene expression in the sphere cells. Radiosensitivity of the sphere cells and parental cells were evaluated by clone formation assay. Different cells after irradiation at different doses were tested to evaluate the changes of sphere formation, and cell cycle and CD44(+)CD271(+) expression of the sphere cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry before and after irradiation. RESULTS: Cancer stem-like cell spheres were generated from KYSE150 and TE1 cells and enriched by culture in serum-free medium, and the number of spheres was increasing alone with the increase of cell passages. The numbers of spheres formed from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations of KYSE150 cells were 25 ± 2, 37 ± 2 and 47 ± 3, respectively. The numbers of spheres formed from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations of TE1 cells were 15 ± 3, 24 ± 3 and 36 ± 4, respectively. Certain doses of radiation increased the sphere formation rate. The average survival fraction (SF2) of the suspension-cultured KYSE150 stem-like cell spheres after 2 Gy irradiation were 0.81 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ± 0.04, while that of TE1 parental cells were 0.87 ± 0.01 and 0.80 ± 0.03 (P < 0.05 for all). In the esophageal parental KYSE150 and TE1 cells, arrest at G2 phase was induced after irradiation. After the same dose of irradiation, the inhibition of proliferation of the cancer stem cells was lower than that of the parent cells (P < 0.05). After 0, 4 and 8 Gy irradiation, the CD44(+)CD271(+) cell percentage of KYSE150 parental cells were (1.08 ± 0.03)%, (1.29 ± 0.07)% and (1.11 ± 0.09)%; the CD44(+)CD271(+) cell percentage of TE1 parental cells were (1.16 ± 0.11)%, (0.97 ± 0.08)% and (1.45 ± 0.35)% (P > 0.05 for all). After 0, 4 and 8 Gy irradiation, the percentage of CD44(+)CD271(+) cells of KYSE150 stem cell-like spheres were (35.83 ± 1.23)%, (44.90 ± 1.67)% and (57.77 ± 1.88)%, and that of TE1 stem cell-like spheres were (16.07 ± 0.91)%, (22.67 ± 1.12)% and (33.27 ± 1.07)%. Compared the 4 Gy and 8 Gy irradiated KYSE150 and TE1 stem-like cell spheres with the 0 Gy irradiated spheres, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: The cancer stem cells in KYSE150 and TE1 spheres are more radio-resistant than their parental cells. It may suggest that cancer stem cell populations in the esophageal cancer cells are related to the mechanism of occurrence of radioresistance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Cycle","uri":{"id":"D002453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Flow Cytometry","uri":{"id":"D005434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D013234","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophageal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D004938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplastic Stem Cells","uri":{"id":"D014411","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"G2 Phase","uri":{"id":"D016195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophagitis","uri":{"id":"D004941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Family Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D005191","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parents","uri":{"id":"D010290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation Tolerance","uri":{"id":"D011836","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suspensions","uri":{"id":"D013535","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430022","title":"[Radiobiological characteristics of cancer stem cells from esophageal cancer cell lines].","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer in improving quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy and knowledge and in reducing distress, uncertainty and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for trials using a range of electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO to October 2013, together with handsearching of journals and reference lists. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if they included psychosocial interventions that explicitly used one or a combination of the following approaches: cognitive behavioural, psycho-educational, supportive and counselling. Interventions had to be delivered or facilitated by trained or lay personnel. Our outcomes were an improvement in quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy and knowledge and a reduction in distress, uncertainty and depression. We analysed data using standardised mean differences (SMDs), random-effects models and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Nineteen studies with a total of 3204 men, with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, comparing psychosocial interventions versus usual care were included in this review. Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a small, statistically significant improvement in the physical component of general health-related quality of life (GHQoL) at end of intervention. There was no clear evidence of benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for the mental component of GHQoL at end of intervention. At end of intervention, cancer-related QoL showed a small improvement following psychosocial interventions. For prostate cancer- specific and symptom-related QoL, the differences between intervention and control groups were not significant. There was no clear evidence that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in improving self-efficacy at end of intervention. Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a moderate increase in prostate cancer knowledge at end of intervention. A small increase in knowledge with psychosocial interventions was noted at three months post-intervention. The results for uncertainty (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.26) and distress at end of intervention were compatible with both benefit and harm based on very low-quality evidence. Finally, there was no clear evidence of benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for depression at end of intervention . CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review shows that psychosocial interventions may have small, short-term beneficial effects on certain domains of wellbeing, as measured by the physical component of GHQoL and cancer-related QoL when compared with usual care. Prostate cancer knowledge was also increased. However, this review failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on other domains such as symptom-related QoL, self- efficacy, uncertainty, distress or depression. Moreover, when beneficial effects were observed, it remained uncertain whether the magnitude of effect was large enough to be considered clinically important. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was rated as very low according to GRADE, reflecting study limitations, loss to follow-up, study heterogeneity and small sample sizes. We were unable to perform meaningful subgroup analyses based on disease stage or treatment modality. Although some findings of this review are encouraging, they do not provide sufficiently strong evidence to permit meaningful conclusions about the effects of these interventions in men with prostate cancer. Additional well-done and transparently reported research studies are necessary to establish the role of psychosocial interventions in men with prostate cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BJU

A cross-sectional serological survey involving multistage simple random sampling was conducted to investigate the prevalence of JD in camels of Oman. In total, 2255 camels (254 males and 2001 females) and different ages from 553 geographically marked holdings were bled for serum. The samples were analyzed by a commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with protein 'G' as conjugate (LSI VET Ruminant Serum Paratuberculosis Advanced, France). Results indicated a widespread herd and individual level seroprevalence, respectively of 9.2 % (95 % CI = 0.7-50) and 2.6 % (95 % CI = 2.0-3.4) in Oman. Differences (p < 0.01) were observed regarding the prevalence of JD in sampled governorates, and the highest prevalence was recorded in Dhofar (13.5 %). Higher (p > 0.05) seroprevalence was observed in females (2.8 %), and their odds for testing positive were 3.69 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.90-15.23) times higher as compared to males (0.8 %). Seropositivity increased with the age of camels, and the highest prevalence (4.4 %) was observed in camels of more than 10 years of age (p = 0.03). Large and medium size herds (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95 % CI = 0.96-3.24) where camels were kept as single species (OR = 1.54, 95 % CI = 0.84-2.84) and confined (OR = 1.93, 95 % CI = 1.05-3.54) were found more likely to test positive. This is the first record of seroprevalence of JD among the camels in the country which highlights their potential as an important host of the disease. The results advocate that a comprehensive control program based upon further risk analysis and molecular study should be devised in Oman.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Tropical animal health

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Immune monitoring (IM) has not been shown to be associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). METHODS: Maximal intimal area, average percent stenosis, plaque volume, and maximal intimal thickness (MIT) were measured for matched baseline and one-year IVUS segments in a blinded fashion. Patients were divided into quartiles by IM scores and outcomes compared. Optimal IM cutoff was determined. RESULTS: IM assays were measured at 63.7±16.4 days after transplantation in fifty patients. Progression of maximal intimal area (p=0.005), average percent stenosis (p<0.001), plaque volume (p=0.005), and MIT (p=0.001) were increased across the quartiles. An optimal IM assay cutoff of 406.0 ngATP/ml demonstrated a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 94.3% for predicting rapid progression of MIT≥0.5 mm. Mean IM scores for Group 1 versus Group 2 were 176.4±102.2 and 616.3±239.5 ngATP/ml, respectively. Rapid progression of MIT≥0.5 mm occurred in 5/38 patients (13.2%) in Group 1 versus 10/12 patients (83.3%) in Group 2 (p<0.001). The risk ratio for rapid progression with elevated IM was 11.7 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Elevated early IM scores are associated with progression of CAV by IVUS. These findings suggest the potential of IM for tailoring of immunosuppressive regimens to minimize progression of CAV in high risk patients. This article is protected by copyright.

These interactions can range from minor rubbing to severe mechanical injury. Further, in the case of radial access, even atraumatic interactions have consequences ranging from clinical complications, such as radial spasm and radial occlusion, to lasting endothelial cell dysfunction. These consequences may be underappreciated; however, endothelial cells play a central role in maintaining vascular homeostasis via nitric oxide production. Existing treatment paradigms do not address endothelial dysfunction or damage and, thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Nanomedicine, in particular, offers great potential in the form of targeted drug delivery, via functionalized coatings or nanocarriers, aimed at increased nitric oxide bioavailability or reduced inflammation.

AIM: To determine the relationship between resolution of NASH and dyslipidemia. METHODS: Individuals in the Pioglitazone vs. Vitamin E vs. Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial with paired liver biopsies and fasting lipid levels were included (N = 222). In the PIVENS trial individuals were randomised to pioglitazone 30 mg, vitamin E 800 IU or placebo for 96 weeks. Change in lipid levels at 96 weeks was compared between those with and without NASH resolution. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia at baseline was frequent, with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (<40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women) in 63%, hypertriglyceridaemia (≥150 mg/dL) in 46%, hypercholesterolaemia (≥200 mg/dL) in 47% and triglycerides (TG)/HDL >5.0 in 25%. Low-density lipoprotein (LD) ≥160 mg/dL was found in 16% and elevated non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (≥130 mg/dL) in 73%. HDL increased with NASH resolution but decreased in those without resolution (2.9 mg/dL vs. -2.5 mg/dL, P < 0.001). NASH resolution was associated with significant decreases in TG and TG/HDL ratio compared to those without resolution (TG: -21.1 vs. -2.3 mg/dL, P = 0.03 and TG/HDL: -0.7 vs. 0.1, P = 0.003). Non-HDL-C, LDL and cholesterol decreased over 96 weeks in both groups, but there was no significant difference between groups. Treatment group did not impact lipids. CONCLUSIONS: NASH resolution is associated with improvements in TG and HDL but not in other cardiovascular disease risk factors including LDL and non-HDL-C levels. Individuals with resolution of NASH may still be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Genetic variations in the IL-17A and IL-17F genes may be associated with a risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a typical inflammation-related cancer. However, their relationship with HBV-related HCC has not been thoroughly investigated. We conducted a case-control study including 155 patients with HBV-related HCC and 171 healthy controls to assess the association between IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms and risk of HCC. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms between the HBV-related HCC patients and healthy controls. However, our results revealed a statistically significant association between the ACA haplotype and increased HCC risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.820, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.181-2.624, P = 0.013]. In contrast, the GCG haplotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HBV-related HCC (OR 0.454, 95 % CI 0.112-0.898, P = 0.035). Our results suggest that IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms do not contribute to HBV-related HCC susceptibility independently. However, the ACA and GCG haplotypes in the IL-17 gene might be a risk factor and a protective marker, respectively, for HBV-related HCC in a Chinese population.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London,

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic thoracic pain after cardiac surgery is prevalent (11 to 56%) and may affect patients' physical and mental health status. Despite its favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, high doses of remifentanil administered during surgery are reported to cause acute postoperative pain and increased requirements for analgesics. Recently, an association between remifentanil use and the incidence of chronic thoracic pain in the long term was also reported. Our objective is to investigate the influence of the intraoperative remifentanil on chronic postoperative pain in a prospective randomized controlled trial.Methods/design: In this prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, all patients (N =126) between 18 and 85 years undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy receive a continuous infusion of propofol together with intermittent intravenous fentanyl at predetermined times perioperatively. Patients are randomized to receive either an additional continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.15 mug-1kgIBW-1 min-1) or additional fentanyl (200 to 500 mug) as needed during surgery.The primary end point is the prevalence of chronic thoracic pain 12 months after surgery. Secondary end points include acute postoperative pain; postoperative analgesic use; chronic thoracic pain 3 and 6 months after surgery; quality of life (SF-12) at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery; work productivity; and use of health care. In addition, thermal detection and pain thresholds are measured preoperatively, 3 days after surgery and 12 months after surgery using quantitative sensory testing (QST). Finally, the influence of several genetic variances on the different outcomes will be measured. DISCUSSION: Chronic thoracic pain is prevalent after cardiac surgery, and research is needed to minimize the risk of chronic persistent postoperative pain, which is an invalidating, long-term complication of surgery. The objective of this trial is to determine the influence of perioperative remifentanil on long-term pain outcomes for cardiac patients in a prospective randomized trial. The results may be used to optimize perioperative analgesia techniques and, thereby, improve quality of life after cardiac surgery.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02031016 on 13 December

Participants were 2,193 mixed race adolescents (M = 14 years old) from 9 schools (4 intervention, 5 control) near Cape Town, South Africa. Students in the HealthWise school with the greatest involvement in teacher training and implementation fidelity reported increased intrinsic and identified motivation and decreased introjected motivation and amotivation compared to students in control schools. These results point to the potential for intervention programming to influence leisure motivation among adolescents in South Africa and represent a first step toward identifying leisure motivation as a mediator of program effects.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of leisure research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Behavior","uri":{"id":"D015438","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk-Taking","uri":{"id":"D012309","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"South Africa","uri":{"id":"D013019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Program Evaluation","uri":{"id":"D015397","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Africa","uri":{"id":"D000349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leisure Activities","uri":{"id":"D007899","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Schools","uri":{"id":"D012574","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Students","uri":{"id":"D013334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Continental Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Curriculum","uri":{"id":"D003479","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429164","title":"Influencing Adolescent Leisure Motivation: Intervention Effects of HealthWise South Africa.","year":"2010"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease leading to cardiovascular complications responsible for a high level of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence tends to hold that humoral and cellular immune responses are a key component of human atherosclerosis development. Since the last decade, auto-antibodies have been identified as active mediators of cardiovascular disease, some presenting protective effects whereas others act as potential risk factors. This review presents an overview of the most relevant auto-antibodies with regards to their respective cardiovascular prognostic value in acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiomyopathies, and their potential pathophysiologic implication in atherogenesis. Insights in the mechanisms of action of the auto-antibodies show that they commonly modulate the innate immune system towards a pro- or anti-inflammatory response and/or affect the regulation of basal heart rate. The increased understanding of the auto-antibodies functional properties has led to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting the innate immune system or the epitope-binding site. Some of these auto-antibodies have been reported to be independent prognostic factors of poor disease outcome. In addition to conventional risk factors, these autoantibodies could be helpful biomarkers to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the cardiovascular stratification tools, improving prognostication, diagnostic and the use of specific therapy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current drug targets","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chronic Disease","uri":{"id":"D002908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiovascular Diseases","uri":{"id":"D002318","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Rate","uri":{"id":"D006339","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immune System","uri":{"id":"D007107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity, Cellular","uri":{"id":"D007111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity, Innate","uri":{"id":"D007113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acute Coronary Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D054058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents","uri":{"id":"D000893","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dilatation","uri":{"id":"D004106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Morbidity","uri":{"id":"D009017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiomyopathies","uri":{"id":"D009202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Periodicity","uri":{"id":"D010507","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D013577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atherosclerosis","uri":{"id":"D050197","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Autoantibodies","uri":{"id":"D001323","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humoralism","uri":{"id":"D019364","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429713","title":"Auto-antibodies as possible markers and mediators of ischemic, dilated, and rhythmic cardiopathies.","year":"2014"}
