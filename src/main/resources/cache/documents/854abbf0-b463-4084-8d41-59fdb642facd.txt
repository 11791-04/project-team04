{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Market authorization does not guarantee patient access to any given drug. This is particularly true for costly orphan drugs because access depends primarily on co-payments, reimbursement policies and prices. The objective of this article is to identify differences in the availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US. METHODS: Four rare diseases were selected for analysis: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Fabry disease (FD), hereditary angioedema (HAE) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Indicators for availability were defined as (i) the indications for which orphan drugs had been authorized in the treatment of these diseases; (ii) the application date; and (iii) the date upon which these drugs received market authorization in each country. Indicators of patient access were defined as (i) the outcomes of technology appraisals; (ii) the extent of coverage provided by healthcare payers; and (iii) the price of the drugs in each country. For PAH we analysed bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil, treprostinil (intravenous and inhaled) as well as sitaxentan and ambrisentan; for FD we analysed agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta; for HAE we analysed icatibant, ecallantide and two complement C1s inhibitors; for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country. The broadest range of indications was found in Australia, and the largest variations in indications were found for PAH drugs. Authorization process speed (the time between application and market authorization) was fastest in the US, with an average of 362 days, followed by the EU (394 days). The highest prices for the included drugs were found in Germany and the US, and the lowest in Canada, Australia and England. Although the prices of all of the included drugs were high compared with those of most non-orphan drugs, most of the insurance plans in our country sample provided coverage for authorized drugs after a certain threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of and access to orphan drugs play a key role in determining whether patients will receive adequate and efficient treatment. Although the present study showed some variations between countries in selected indicators of availability and access to orphan drugs, virtually all of the drugs in question were available and accessible in our sample. However, substantial co-payments in the US and Canada represent important barriers to patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient for the treatment of a common indication.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PharmacoEconomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians must choose between an increasing number of medications for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with different routes of administration, adverse effects, costs and efficacies. We constructed a decision analysis to help inform treatment choices in PAH. METHODS: We created a Markov-type model to evaluate 1-year treatment with bosentan, treprostinil, epoprostenol, inhaled iloprost, sildenafil, sitaxentan and ambrisentan. Transition probabilities were based on observed transitions between WHO functional classes, adjusted by relative risk of improvement in a 6-minute walk test. Utilities were based on reported values for each functional class, adjusted for burden of treatment administration. Costs were estimated from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement data. Sensitivity analyses evaluated changes in efficacy, utilities and costs. RESULTS: Treatment with sildenafil was less costly and resulted in a greater gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with other treatments. Treatment with ambrisentan and bosentan resulted in the same gain in QALYs as sildenafil, but at a higher cost. Sensitivity analyses had minimal impact on these results. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, sildenafil is a cost-effective treatment for PAH with a low price and a net increase in QALYs. The results from this analysis are a tool to help guide clinicians in deciding which PAH medications to use; however, the final decisions should be individualized because the effectiveness of therapy, resulting utilities and acceptable costs will differ with each patient.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Clinical drug

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: As prescription drug expenditures increase, third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing costs and reimbursement guidelines, such as for medications that treat chronic conditions that are not necessarily directly life threatening (i.e., obesity, nicotine addiction, and erectile dysfunction). AIM: To review the costs and consequences of pharmacy benefit reimbursement policies related to erectile dysfunction therapies, using sildenafil citrate as the case study. METHODS: Data and references were found through searches of PubMed and Google. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To meet the varied health needs of a defined population under reasonable resource constraints requires analysis of cost and of the economic and non-economic consequences of a treatment. Based on analysis of sildenafil data, oral therapy of erectile dysfunction provides substantial cost savings when compared with other treatment options and contributes insignificant overall costs to health plans. Regardless, health plans impose controls to limit reimbursement. Because erectile dysfunction is often a precursor to other conditions, such limitations could compromise detection and management of underlying disease (e.g., depressive, cardiovascular, and urogenital). Reimbursement restrictions may also decrease membership satisfaction and re-enrollment rates.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The journal of sexual

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Previous theoretical and empirical work on health policy decisions about reimbursement focuses on specific rationales such as effectiveness, economic considerations and equal access for equal needs. As reimbursement decisions take place in a social and political context we propose that the analysis of decision-making should incorporate factors, which go beyond those commonly discussed. As an example we chose three health technologies (sildenafil, rivastigmine and statins) to investigate how decisions about reimbursement of medicines are made in the United Kingdom National Health Service and what factors influence these decisions. From face-to-face, in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 20 regional and national policy makers and stakeholders we identified two dimensions of decision-making, which extend beyond the rationales conventionally cited. The first dimension relates to the role of 'subjectivity' or 'the personal' in the decisions, including personal experiences of the condition and excitement about the novelty or potential benefit of the technology-these factors affect what counts as evidence, or how evidence is interpreted, in practice. The second dimension relates to the social and political function of decision-making and broadens what counts as the relevant ends of decision-making to include such things as maintaining relationships, avoiding organisational burden, generating politically and legally defensible decisions and demonstrating the willingness to care. More importantly, we will argue that these factors should not be treated as contaminants of an otherwise rational decision-making. On the contrary we suggest that they seem relevant, reasonable and also of substantial importance in considering in decision-making. Complementing the analysis of decision-making about reimbursement by incorporating these factors could increase our understanding and potentially improve decision-making.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Policy","uri":{"id":"D006291","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services","uri":{"id":"D006296","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Health Programs","uri":{"id":"D009313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Administrative Personnel","uri":{"id":"D000288","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Great Britain","uri":{"id":"D006113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomedical Technology","uri":{"id":"D020811","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Politics","uri":{"id":"D011057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health","uri":{"id":"D006262","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Policy","uri":{"id":"D057766","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Decision Making, Organizational","uri":{"id":"D003659","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Great Britain","uri":{"id":"D006113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"State Medicine","uri":{"id":"D013222","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Policy","uri":{"id":"D006291","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reimbursement Mechanisms","uri":{"id":"D012051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Costs","uri":{"id":"D016527","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Decision Making, Organizational","Drug Costs","Great Britain","Health Policy","Reimbursement Mechanisms","State Medicine"]},"pmid":"16039351","title":"Reimbursement decisions in health policy--extending our understanding of the elements of decision-making.","year":"2005"}

In Sweden priority setting decisions are governed by law in which it is stated that decisions should be guided by firstly the principle of need and secondly the principle of cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the paper is to discuss and illustrate the roles of need and cost-effectiveness in decisions on inclusion or not of treatment strategies in the publicly financed health care. METHODS: The theoretical backgrounds of need and cost-effectiveness are discussed in short, both with respect to their meaning and to their potential roles in decisions on priority setting. Four treatment strategies, Viagra, Rivastigmine, statins, and lung transplants, are analysed with respect to whether either cost-effectiveness or need, or both, seem to have played a role in the decisions of inclusion or not in the basic health care package. RESULTS: Both need and cost-effectiveness are important and should be important aspects when making decisions on priority setting. From the examples of the four treatment strategies it seems that decisions are almost exclusively made with reference to the principle of need. CONCLUSIONS: The most evident conclusion to be drawn from this study is that decisions on priority setting are almost solely based on the principle of need. This implies that the principle of cost-effectiveness is given very little space, which is a problem as this means an obvious risk of inefficient resource use.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung Transplantation","uri":{"id":"D016040","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Healthcare Financing","uri":{"id":"D061889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung","uri":{"id":"D008168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sweden","uri":{"id":"D013548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Principle-Based Ethics","uri":{"id":"D028662","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health","uri":{"id":"D006262","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services Needs and Demand","uri":{"id":"D006301","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Role","uri":{"id":"D012380","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Set (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D012718","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cost-Benefit Analysis","uri":{"id":"D003362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Decision Making, Organizational","uri":{"id":"D003659","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Priorities","uri":{"id":"D006292","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services Needs and Demand","uri":{"id":"D006301","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Health, Reimbursement","uri":{"id":"D007349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Health Programs","uri":{"id":"D009313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Politics","uri":{"id":"D011057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sweden","uri":{"id":"D013548","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Cost-Benefit Analysis","Decision Making, Organizational","Health Priorities","Health Services Needs and Demand","Humans","Insurance, Health, Reimbursement","National Health Programs","Politics","Sweden"]},"pmid":"14769012","title":"Decisions on inclusion in the Swedish basic health care package--roles of cost-effectiveness and need.","year":"2003"}

However, businesses are not keen on the idea of covering contraception in health plans.  They argue that the role of health insurance is to treat illness and provide a safety net between health disasters and destitution, thus excluding pregnancy since it is not an illness or a disaster.  If this were the case, then erectile dysfunction would not qualify any more than pregnancy, yet health plans nationwide are agreeing to cover the drug Viagra.  Moreover, they say that a change in policy would cause an immediate increase in reimbursement expenses, as well as stop small business from providing health coverage due to its cost.  Helping women plan their pregnancies is cost-effective, and helping female employees prevent unintended pregnancies will save far more money than skimping on prescription coverage.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Reproductive freedom news / from the Center for Reproductive Law &

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Coverage of sildenafil by health insurance plans is a contentious issue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sildenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction. DESIGN: A Markov decision model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of sildenafil compared with no drug therapy. DATA SOURCES: Values for the efficacy and safety of sildenafil and quality-of-life utilities were obtained from the published medical literature. Base-case values were chosen to bias against sildenafil use. TARGET POPULATION: Men 60 years of age with erectile dysfunction. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal and third-party payer. INTERVENTION: Sildenafil or no treatment in identical hypothetical cohorts. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost per QALY gained for sildenafil treatment compared with no therapy was $11,290 from the societal perspective and $11,230 from the third-party payer perspective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: From the societal perspective, the cost per QALY gained associated with sildenafil was less than $50,000 if treatment-related morbidity was less than 0.8% per year, mortality was less than 0.55% per year, treatment was successful in more than 40.2% of patients, or sildenafil cost less than $244 per month. The results were sensitive to variation of erectile dysfunction utilities, but cost per QALY gained was less than $50,000 if successful treatment increased utility values by 0.05 or more on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis biased against use of sildenafil, the cost-effectiveness of sildenafil treatment compared favorably with that of accepted therapies for other medical conditions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Annals of internal

This study examines what coverage decisions insurers make and the information and processes used in making these decisions. Fifty-three organizations, differing in size, tax status, and region, were asked about their policies for four new and controversial drugs: Viagra, Enbrel, Zyban, and Celebrex. Enbrel and Celebrex were much more likely to be covered than Viagra and Zyban. In addition, coverage of Enbrel and Celebrex was limited through strategies such as prior authorization, to encourage medically appropriate use of these agents, whereas coverage of Viagra and Zyban was limited predominantly through generalized exclusion or through restrictions on quantity or duration of use. Value judgments, rather than cost, seem to play a central, though largely unspoken, role in these coverage decisions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health affairs (Project

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Due to its specific action on the intracavernous mechanism of erection, sildenafil is the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction therefore much more effective than earlier oral therapies. Patient acceptance is greatly improved with the simple oral dose one hour before sexual activity, avoiding commonly observed dissatisfaction with intracavernal injections or vacuum devices: will its efficiency be the same? Treatment with nitrate derivatives for angina pectoris is the major contraindication. Global management, for the patient and his partner, remains essential for optimal efficacy of this new compound. Considering patient habits and medical prescriptions in France where use of anti-anxiety and anti-insomnia drugs is relatively high but use of vitamins and regenerating drugs relatively low, only the future will tell whether use of sildenafil will remain within 'reasonable' limits. No decision concerning reimbursement by the French Social Security health care scheme has been made to date.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Presse médicale (Paris, France :
