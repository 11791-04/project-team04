How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification 
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Exposures to environmental toxicants and toxins cause epigenetic changes that likely play a role in the development of diseases associated with exposure. The mechanism behind these exposure-induced epigenetic changes is currently unknown. One commonality between most environmental exposures is that they cause DNA damage either directly or through causing an increase in reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA. Like transcription, DNA damage repair must occur in the context of chromatin requiring both histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. These chromatin changes aid in DNA damage accessibility and signaling. Several proteins and complexes involved in epigenetic silencing during both development and cancer have been found to be localized to sites of DNA damage. The chromatin-based response to DNA damage is considered a transient event, with chromatin being restored to normal as DNA damage repair is completed. However, in individuals chronically exposed to environmental toxicants or with chronic inflammatory disease, repeated DNA damage-induced chromatin rearrangement may ultimately lead to permanent epigenetic alterations. Understanding the mechanism behind exposure-induced epigenetic changes will allow us to develop strategies to prevent or reverse these changes. This review focuses on epigenetic changes and DNA damage induced by environmental exposures, the chromatin changes that occur around sites of DNA damage, and how these transient chromatin changes may lead to heritable epigenetic alterations at sites of chronic exposure.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Environmental and molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women living in the western hemisphere. Despite major advances in first-line endocrine therapy of advanced oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, the frequent recurrence of resistant cancer cells represents a serious obstacle to successful treatment. Understanding the mechanisms leading to acquired resistance, therefore, could pave the way to the development of second-line therapeutics. To this end, we generated an ER-positive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with resistance to the therapeutic anti-oestrogen fulvestrant (FUL) and studied the molecular changes involved in resistance. METHODS: Naive MCF-7 cells were treated with increasing FUL concentrations and the gene expression profile of the resulting FUL-resistant strain (FR.MCF-7) was compared with that of naive cells using GeneChip arrays. After validation by real-time PCR and/or western blotting, selected resistance-associated genes were functionally studied by siRNA-mediated silencing or pharmacological inhibition. Furthermore, general mechanisms causing aberrant gene expression were investigated. RESULTS: Fulvestrant resistance was associated with repression of GPER and the overexpression of CDK6, whereas ERBB2, ABCG2, ER and ER-related genes (GREB1, RERG) or genes expressed in resistant breast cancer (BCAR1, BCAR3) did not contribute to resistance. Aberrant GPER and CDK6 expression was most likely caused by modification of DNA methylation and histone acetylation, respectively. Therefore, part of the resistance mechanism was loss of RB1 control. The hSWI/SNF (human SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) chromatin remodelling complex, which is tightly linked to nucleosome acetylation and repositioning, was also affected, because as a stress response to FUL treatment-naive cells altered the expression of five subunits within a few hours (BRG1, BAF250A, BAF170, BAF155, BAF47). The aberrant constitutive expression of BAF250A, BAF170 and BAF155 and a deviant stress response of BRG1, BAF170 and BAF47 in FR.MCF-7 cells to FUL treatment accompanied acquired FUL resistance. The regular and aberrant expression profiles of BAF155 correlated directly with that of CDK6 in naive and in FR.MCF-7 cells corroborating the finding that CDK6 overexpression was due to nucleosome alterations. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that FUL resistance is associated with the dysregulation of GPER and CDK6. A mechanism leading to aberrant gene expression was most likely unscheduled chromatin remodelling by hSWI/SNF. Hence, three targets should be conceptually addressed in a second-line adjuvant therapy: the catalytic centre of SWI/SNF (BRG1) to delay the development of FUL resistance, GPER to increase sensitivity to FUL and the reconstitution of the RB1 pathway to overcome resistance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"British journal of

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression. Somatic dysregulation of NSD1 and EZH2 have been associated with tumorigenesis. NSD1, as a fusion transcript with NUP98, plays a key role in leukemogenesis, particularly childhood acute myeloid leukemia. EZH2 is a major proto-oncogene and mono- and biallelic activating and inactivating somatic mutations occur as early events in the development of tumors, particularly poor prognosis hematopoietic malignancies. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. NSD1 mutations that cause Sotos syndrome are loss-of-function, primarily truncating mutations or missense mutations at key residues in functional domains. EZH2 mutations that cause Weaver syndrome are primarily missense variants and the rare truncating mutations reported to date are in the last exon, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be generating the overgrowth phenotype although the exact mechanism has not yet been determined. Many additional questions about the molecular and clinical features of NSD1 and EZH2 remain unanswered. However, studies are underway to address these and, as more cases are ascertained and technology improves, it is hoped that these will, in time, be answered.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"American journal of medical genetics.

Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications often occurring on the cytosine of CpG islands located in gene promoter regions, which is thought to be closely correlated with tumorigenesis. The inducibility and reversibility of DNA methylation provide us an insight into tumor development and treatment. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is associated with the progress of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacytidine and decitabine) have achieved suc-cess in treating high-and intermediate-risk MDS. This will bring new ideas to understand the cause and develop the treat-ment of MDS. This review mainly introduces the latest progress of the action mechanism of those two medicines, the clini-cal effect and new problems during the clinical application on MDS.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Yi chuan = Hereditas / Zhongguo yi chuan xue hui bian

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Methylation is a post-translational modification that can affect numerous features of proteins, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. Recent genome-wide analyses have considerably extended the list of human genes encoding putative methyltransferases. Studies on protein methyltransferases have revealed that the regulatory function of methylation is not limited to epigenetics, with many non-histone substrates now being discovered. We present here our findings on a novel family of distantly related putative methyltransferases. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry shows a marked preference for these proteins to associate with various chaperones. Based on the spectral data, we were able to identify methylation sites in substrates, notably trimethylation of K135 of KIN/Kin17, K561 of HSPA8/Hsc70 as well as corresponding lysine residues in other Hsp70 isoforms, and K315 of VCP/p97. All modification sites were subsequently confirmed in vitro. In the case of VCP, methylation by METTL21D was stimulated by the addition of the UBX cofactor ASPSCR1, which we show directly interacts with the methyltransferase. This stimulatory effect was lost when we used VCP mutants (R155H, R159G, and R191Q) known to cause Inclusion Body Myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and Fronto-temporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and/or familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Lysine 315 falls in proximity to the Walker B motif of VCP's first ATPase/D1 domain. Our results indicate that methylation of this site negatively impacts its ATPase activity. Overall, this report uncovers a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for molecular chaperones and defines a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of degenerative neuromuscular diseases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PLoS

Technologies allowing the targeting of epigenetic enzymes to predetermined DNA sequences are uniquely suited to answer such questions and could provide potent (bio)medical tools. Toward the goal of gene-specific GEM by overwriting epigenetic marks (Epigenetic Editing, EGE), instructive epigenetic marks need to be identified and their writers/erasers should then be fused to gene-specific DNA binding domains. The appropriate epigenetic mark(s) to change in order to efficiently modulate gene expression might have to be validated for any given chromatin context and should be (mitotically) stable. Various insights in such issues have been obtained by sequence-specific targeting of epigenetic enzymes, as is presented in this review. Features of such studies provide critical aspects for further improving EGE. An example of this is the direct effect of the edited mark versus the indirect effect of recruited secondary proteins by targeting epigenetic enzymes (or their domains). Proof-of-concept of expression modulation of an endogenous target gene is emerging from the few EGE studies reported. Apart from its promise in correcting disease-associated epi-mutations, EGE represents a powerful tool to address fundamental epigenetic questions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["DNA Methylation","DNA Modification Methylases","DNA-Binding Proteins","Down-Regulation","Epigenesis, Genetic","Histone Deacetylases","Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase","Histones","Protein Structure, Tertiary"]},"pmid":"23002135","title":"Epigenetic Editing: targeted rewriting of epigenetic marks to modulate expression of selected target genes.","year":"2012"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Recent studies suggest that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can alter the differentiation potential of stem cells or progenitor cells. Specifically, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is known to act as a coactivator for various transcription factors and to regulate gene expression by chromatin remodeling through histone methylation. Here, for the first time, we have used direct protein delivery of CARM1 using cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) to regulate the differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Immunofluorescence showed that the CPP-CARM1 protein is successfully delivered into the nuclei of hMSCs. Further experiments using immunofluorescence and Western blotting showed that the delivered CARM1 protein can effectively methylate the arginine 17 residue of histone H3 in both bone marrow (BM)- and adipose-derived (AD)-hMSCs, thus suggesting that the CARM1 protein delivered by the CPP system is biologically active in hMSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and genome-wide gene expression profiling supported the result that delivered CARM1 protein can cause chromatin remodeling through histone methylation. Finally, the CPP-CARM1 protein efficiently elevated the differentiation efficiency of BM-hMSCs and AD-hMSCs into adipogenic, osteogenic, and myogenic cell lineages in vitro. Altered expression of critical genes after hMSC differentiation was reconfirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Collectively, our results suggest that CPP-CARM1 can elevate the differentiation potential of hMSCs into various cell types, and that this system using CPP is a useful tool for exogenous protein delivery in clinical applications of cell-based therapy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Cell Differentiation","Cell-Penetrating Peptides","Gene Expression","Humans","Mesenchymal Stromal Cells","Microarray Analysis","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases","Transcription, Genetic"]},"pmid":"22696466","title":"Regulation of differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells by intracytoplasmic delivery of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 protein using cell-penetrating peptide.","year":"2012"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic, nonessential transition metal and contributes a health risk to humans, including various cancers and cardiovascular diseases; however, underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Cells transmit information to the next generation via two distinct ways: genetic and epigenetic. Chemical modifications to DNA or histone that alters the structure of chromatin without change of DNA nucleotide sequence are known as epigenetics. These heritable epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, post-translational modifications of histone tails (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc), and higher order packaging of DNA around nucleosomes. Apart from DNA methyltransferases, histone modification enzymes such as histone acetyltransferase, histone deacetylase, and methyltransferase, and microRNAs (miRNAs) all involve in these epigenetic changes. Recent studies indicate that Cd is able to induce various epigenetic changes in plant and mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Since aberrant epigenetics plays a critical role in the development of various cancers and chronic diseases, Cd may cause the above-mentioned pathogenic risks via epigenetic mechanisms. Here we review the in vitro and in vivo evidence of epigenetic effects of Cd. The available findings indicate that epigenetics occurred in association with Cd induction of malignant transformation of cells and pathological proliferation of tissues, suggesting that epigenetic effects may play a role in Cd toxic, particularly carcinogenic effects. The future of environmental epigenomic research on Cd should include the role of epigenetics in determining long-term and late-onset health effects following Cd

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Epigenetics refers to changes in phenotype and gene expression that occur without alterations in DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications of the genome can be acquired de novo and are potentially heritable. This review focuses on the emerging recognition of a role for epigenetics in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Lessons learned from the epigenetics in cancer and neurodevelopmental diseases, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, can be applied to PAH. These syndromes suggest that there is substantial genetic and epigenetic cross-talk such that a single phenotype can result from a genetic cause, an epigenetic cause, or a combined abnormality. There are three major mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including methylation of CpG islands, mediated by DNA methyltransferases, modification of histone proteins, and microRNAs. There is substantial interaction between these epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, it was discovered that there may be an epigenetic component to PAH. In PAH there is downregulation of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and normoxic activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α). This decrease in SOD2 results from methylation of CpG islands in SOD2 by lung DNA methyltransferases. The partial silencing of SOD2 alters redox signaling, activates HIF-1α) and leads to excessive cell proliferation. The same hyperproliferative epigenetic abnormality occurs in cancer. These epigenetic abnormalities can be therapeutically reversed. Epigenetic mechanisms may mediate gene-environment interactions in PAH and explain the great variability in susceptibility to stimuli such as anorexigens, virus, and shunts. Epigenetics may be relevant to the female predisposition to PAH and the incomplete penetrance of BMPR2 mutations in familial PAH.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Pulmonary

Invasive and metastatic cancer cells have undergone numerous genetic and epigenetic changes, manifested by cytoskeletal changes, loss of adhesion, and expression of proteolytic enzymes that degrade the basement membrane. Additionally, in endothelial cells, some epigenetic modifications occur during the formation of angiogenesis. Researchers have used some methylation inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, or methylating agents (such as S-adenosylmethionine, SAM) against cancer and angiogenesis. Although they are effective to beat these diseases, each one results in differentiation or changes in genome structure.

Several other bacterial and eukaryotic proteins have since been shown to be alpha-N-methylated. However, the Ran guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, RCC1, is the only protein for which any biological function of alpha-N-methylation has been identified. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA and cause mitotic defects, but further characterization of this modification has been hindered by ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. All fungal and animal N-terminally methylated proteins contain a unique N-terminal motif, Met-(Ala/Pro/Ser)-Pro-Lys, indicating that they may be targets of the same, unknown enzyme. The initiating Met is cleaved, and the exposed alpha-amino group is mono-, di- or trimethylated. Here we report the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase, which we named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT). Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous new methylation targets, including SET (also known as TAF-I or PHAPII) and the retinoblastoma protein, RB.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Human cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. The latter alterations involve hypermethylation and hypomethylation of DNA, and changed patterns of histone modification, with resultant remodeling of the chromatin structure that cause deregulation of the transcription activity of many genes. Unlike the remarkable progress in understanding the processes by which DNA methyltransferases can regulate gene expression and histone deacetylases can induce alteration of chromatin structure, the roles of epigenetic events in tumors remain insufficiently explained. In contrast to genetic changes, the epigenetic alterations in cancer cells can be reversed by the inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Therefore, many inhibition agents for re-expression, predominantly of tumor-suppressor genes, have been identified and tested in laboratory models and numerous clinical trials. Despite in-vitro evidence that a single drug can lead to reactivation of methylated genes, inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases have been investigated in combination, or together with cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or hormonal therapy to improve the therapeutic effect. Ongoing trials are recognizing that the identification of a target group of patients who are more likely to respond to the epigenetic therapy, defining of an optimal dose and schedule of treatment, and the development of more specific inhibitors with minimal unwanted side effects are necessary. Thus, new combinations of anticancer agents, including epigenetic modulators, may lead to a more effective control of cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Anti-cancer

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Benzene is an established hematotoxic carcinogen which can cause leukemia. DNA damage and disorder of repair capacity are the crucial mechanisms in leukemogenesis of benzene. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) are two kinds of key epigenetic modification reagents. The mRNA expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 (PARP-1), a pivotal repair gene, has been decreased by benzene. However, the effect of epigenetic modification on benzene-induced low PARP-1 expression has not been reported. In this study, lymphoblastoid cell line F32 was incubated by benzene and then further treated with 5-aza and TSA, alone or in combination. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific PCR were performed to examine the mRNA expression and methylation status of PARP-1, respectively. Results showed a dramatic decrease of PARP-1 mRNA expression and a simultaneously obvious increase in the level of PARP-1 methylation in benzene-treated cells compared to the control. Further, the PARP-1 mRNA expression was restored and the level of PARP-1 methylation was also reduced following epigenetic inhibitors, 5-aza and TSA, alone or in combination treatments. Taken together, methylation of PARP-1 promoter might be involved in the regulation of benzene-induced decrease of PARP-1 mRNA expression.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Toxicology

The occurrence of such changes supports the theory that diseases might be cured by altering the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, either directly by modifying the control of the misregulated genes that cause a disease, or indirectly by 'reprogramming' cells toward a 'normal' gene expression pattern. Launched drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases and lead to epigenetic changes are currently in use for the treatment of cancer.

However, the molecular mechanism of silencing of sFRP2 is not fully understood. Our study was designed to elucidate the silencing mechanism of sFRP2 in RCC. Expression of sFRP2 was examined in 20 pairs of primary cancers by immunohistochemistry. Kidney cell lines (HK-2, Caki-1, Caki-2, A-498 and ACHN) were analyzed for sFRP2 expression using real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The methylation status at 46 CpG sites of the 2 CpG islands in the sFRP2 promoter was characterized by bisulfite DNA sequencing. Histone modifications were assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using antibodies against AcH3, AcH4, H3K4 and H3K9. sFRP2 was frequently repressed in primary cancers and in RCC cells. The majority of sFRP2 negative cells had a methylated promoter. Meanwhile, sFRP2 expression was repressed by a hypomethylated promoter in Caki-1 cells, and these cells had a repressive histone modification at the promoter. In Caki-1 cells, sFRP2 was reactivated by trichostatin A (TSA). Repressive histone modifications were also observed in RCC cells with hypermethylated promoters, but sFRP2 was reactivated only by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and not by TSA. However, the activation of the silenced sFRP2 gene could be achieved in all cells using a combination of DAC and TSA. This is the first report indicating that aberrant DNA methylation and histone modifications work together to silence the sFRP2 gene in RCC cells.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of cancer.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"FHIT, at a constitutively active chromosome fragile site, is often a target of chromosomal aberrations and deletion in a large fraction of human tumors. Inactivation of murine Fhit allelessignificantly increases susceptibility of mice to spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. In this study, transgenic mice, carrying a human FHIT cDNA under control of the endogenous promoter, were produced to determine the effect of Fhit expression, from a nonfragile cDNA transgene outside the fragile region, on carcinogen-induced tumor susceptibility of wildtype and Fhit heterozygous mice. Mice received sufficient oral doses of N-nitrosomethybenzylamine (NMBA) to cause forestomach tumors in >80% of nontransgenic control mice. Although the level of expression of the FHIT transgene in the recombinant mouse strains was much lower than the level of endogenous Fhit expression, the tumor burden in NMBA-treated male transgenic mice was significantly reduced, while female transgenic mice were not protected. To determine if the difference in protection could be due to differences in epigenetic changes at the transgene loci in male versus female mice, we examined expression, hypermethylation and induced re-expression of FHIT transgenes in male and female mice or cells derived from them. The transgene was methylated in male and female mice and in cell lines established from male and female transgenic kidneys, the FHIT locus was both hypermethylated and deacetylated. It is likely that the FHIT transgene is more tightly silenced in female transgenic mice, leading to a lack of protection from tumor induction.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cytogenetic and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several nonessential mechanisms including histone variant H2A.Z deposition and transcription-associated histone H3 methylation antagonize the local spread of Sir-dependent silent chromatin into adjacent euchromatic regions. However, it is unclear how and where these factors cooperate. To probe this question, we performed systematic genetic array screens for gene deletions that cause a synthetic growth defect in an htz1Delta mutant but not in an htz1Delta sir3Delta double mutant. Of the four genes identified, three, SET1, SWD1, and SWD3, encode components of the Set1 complex, which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3-K4), a highly conserved modification that occurs in the coding sequences of transcribed genes. Using microarray-based transcriptional profiling, we find that H2A.Z and Set1 cooperate to prevent Sir-dependent repression of a large number of genes located across the genome, rather than the local effects reported previously for the individual mechanisms. This global, redundant function appears to be direct: using a DamID chromatin profiling method, we demonstrate ectopic association of Sir3 and Sir4 in htz1Delta set1Delta mutants at loci distant from silent chromatin domains. Antisilencing mechanisms may therefore cooperate to play a considerably broader role in regulating genome-wide transcription than previously thought.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proceedings

Recent advances in multimodality chemoradiotherapy and surgery has improved survival in patients with loco-regional disease, but most patients with advanced stage esophageal cancer have a poor prognosis. Elucidation of the processes involved in esophageal carcinogenesis has identified a number of promising novel targets for therapy. This review focuses on the current status of targeted therapies with potential application to the treatment of advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer. The future challenge is to confirm the efficacy of these targeted agents in appropriately selected esophageal cancer patients, and successfully integrate these agents into effective therapies for all stages and subtypes of disease.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus / I.S.D.E","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cause of Death","uri":{"id":"D002423","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Staging","uri":{"id":"D009367","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophageal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D004938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophagogastric Junction","uri":{"id":"D004943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophagitis","uri":{"id":"D004941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemoradiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D059248","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogenesis","uri":{"id":"D063646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antineoplastic Agents","uri":{"id":"D000970","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D004791","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Angiogenesis Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D020533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","uri":{"id":"D042461","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophageal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D004938","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metalloendopeptidases","uri":{"id":"D008666","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor","uri":{"id":"D011958","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA Modification Methylases","uri":{"id":"D015254","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyclin-Dependent Kinases","uri":{"id":"D018844","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D056572","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Antineoplastic Agents","Apoptosis","Cyclin-Dependent Kinases","DNA Modification Methylases","Enzyme Inhibitors","Esophageal Neoplasms","Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors","Humans","Metalloendopeptidases","Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"]},"pmid":"17760648","title":"Novel targeted therapies for advanced esophageal cancer.","year":"2007"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Various proteins have been found to play roles in both the repair of UV damaged DNA and heterochromatin-mediated silencing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, factors that are involved in the methylation of lysine-79 of histone H3 by Dot1p have been implicated in both processes, suggesting a bipartite function for this modification. We find that a dot1 null mutation and a histone H3 point mutation at lysine-79 cause increased sensitivity to UV radiation, suggesting that lysine-79 methylation is important for efficient repair of UV damage. Epistasis analysis between dot1 and various UV repair genes indicates that lysine-79 methylation plays overlapping roles within the nucleotide excision, post-replication and recombination repair pathways, as well as RAD9-mediated checkpoint function. In contrast, epistasis analysis with the H3 lysine-79 point mutation indicates that the lysine-to-glutamic acid substitution exerts specific effects within the nucleotide excision repair and post-replication repair pathways, suggesting that this allele only disrupts a subset of the functions of lysine-79 methylation. The overall results indicate the existence of distinct and separable roles of histone H3 lysine-79 methylation in the response to UV damage, potentially serving to coordinate the various repair processes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"DNA

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) is one type of epigenetic modification which was firstly discovered in plant. RdDM can directly cause DNA modifications of the genome through RNA-DNA interactions. In plant, both of RdDM and mRNA degradation induced by siRNA can silence sequence specific genes through RNA. They play very significant roles in chromosome rearrangement, defence of virus invasion, regulation of gene expression and many processes of plant development. However, the mechanisms of RdDM are still unclear. In this paper the basic characteristics of RdDM were briefly summarized and advances in studies on mechanisms of RdDM were reviewed. These include the kinds of DNA methyltransferases and their functional mechanisms in RdDM, the relationships between DNA methylation and chromatin modification, and important proteins involved in the RdDM process. In plants, RdDM may occur at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptionnal levels, both of which induce gene silencing. Methylation of the target gene promoter correlates with transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) whereas methylation of the coding sequence is associated with post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). RdDM and RNAi all depend on the similar siRNA and enzymes, such as DCL3, RdR2, SDE4 and AGO4. There are at least three kinds of DNA methyltransferases, DRM1/2, MET1 and CMT3, in pants. They can interact with and modifies all cytidines within the DNA regions homologous to RNA sequence. Furthermore, methylation of lysine 9 in Histone H3 can affect the methylation of cytidines.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of

To date, several enzymes that catalyze DNA or histone modifications have been identified, such as DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Inhibitors and activators of enzymes controlling epigenetic modifications are considered useful not only as tools for the elucidation of cellular and biological phenomena, but also as therapeutic agents, since disruption of the balance of epigenetic networks is known to cause some disease states such as cancer.

Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) synthesis is high at birth, followed by a decline to adult levels by 10 months of age. The expression of gamma-globin is controlled by a developmentally regulated transcriptional program that is recapitulated during normal erythropoiesis in the adult bone marrow. It is known that naturally occurring mutations in the gamma-gene promoters cause persistent Hb F synthesis after birth, which ameliorates symptoms in SCD by inhibiting hemoglobin S polymerization and vaso-occlusion. Several pharmacological agents have been identified over the past 2 decades that reactivate gamma-gene transcription through different cellular systems. We will review the progress made in our understanding of molecular mechanisms that control gamma-globin expression and insights gained from Hb F-inducing agents that act through signal transduction

Targeted therapeutics are tailored toward the molecular abnormalities that cause tumor progression and could potentially provide an effective, non-toxic therapeutic approach in a broad range of cancers including melanoma. Cancer is as much a (cyto)genetic disease as it is an epigenetic disease. Indeed, the fate of the cell depends on a delicate balance between expression and repression of genes. The notion that drastic changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications are present in a variety of human tumors has prompted the development and characterization of epigenetic drugs. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases and methyltransferases as well as of the proteasome are covered in this review.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Swd2, an essential WD repeat protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a component of two very different complexes: the cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPF and the Set1 methylase, which modifies lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3-K4). It was not known if Swd2 is important for the function of either of these entities. We show here that, in extract from cells depleted of Swd2, cleavage and polyadenylation of the mRNA precursor in vitro are completely normal. However, temperature-sensitive mutations or depletion of Swd2 causes termination defects in some genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Overexpression of Ref2, a protein previously implicated in snoRNA 3' end formation and Swd2 recruitment to CPF, can rescue the growth and termination defects, indicating a functional interaction between the two proteins. Some swd2 mutations also significantly decrease global H3-K4 methylation and cause other phenotypes associated with loss of this chromatin modification, such as loss of telomere silencing, hydroxyurea sensitivity, and alterations in repression of INO1 transcription. Even though the two Swd2-containing complexes are both localized to actively transcribed genes, the allele specificities of swd2 defects suggest that the functions of Swd2 in mediating RNA polymerase II termination and H3-K4 methylation are not tightly coupled.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular and cellular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this paper we present a brief review on DNA methylation, the enzymes and proteins involved in the repression complex and the importance of methylation of FMR1 gene in fragile X syndrome. DEVELOPMENT: Methylation status of control region in the genome plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. In susceptible genes containing CpG island in the promoter, cytosine methylation favors a repressive chromatin structure that prevents the binding of transcriptional activators to the promoter. The enzyme DNA methyltransferase transfers a methyl group from the S-adenosylmethionine to the 5 carbon of cytosine in the CG sequences. Several proteins have been described that recognize the methyl cytosine and recruit the co-repressor and the histones deacetylases. The lost of the acetyl groups produces the compacting of the chromatin. Fragile X syndrome is due, in the majority of the cases, to the expansion above a threshold of the CGG repeats in the first exon of FMR1 gene. These expansions are concomitant with the methylation of the promoter and the silencing of FMR1. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation is a tag that enables different phenotypic expression from an identical nucleotide sequence. Aberrant methylation is the cause of different pathologies including fragile X syndrome. The comprehension of the mechanisms by which methylation induces the silencing of the genes and the study of agents that could revert this process are important for the treatment of these diseases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Revista de
