{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Endocrine therapy is an effective treatment for post-menopausal women with 'oestrogen receptor-positive' invasive breast cancers. There are two main types of endocrine therapies: selective oestrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane). The aim of this study was to compare the patterns of use of endocrine therapies for breast cancer in women between nine developed countries. METHODS: A longitudinal, cross-national drug utilization study was conducted. The endocrine therapies included were tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors: anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Annual drug utilization data were collected from Australia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden over the period 2001-2012. Utilization was measured in DDD/1000 inhabitants/day and was also adjusted for breast cancer incidence and female population statistics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Total use of endocrine therapies either increased or remained steady in all countries. Total endocrine therapy usage was consistently highest in England and France. Norway showed the lowest usage of endocrine therapies overall, using only 1·80 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2012. Downward trends in tamoxifen use and upward trends in aromatase inhibitors were seen across all countries over the study period. By 2012, aromatase inhibitors represented over half of total endocrine therapy use in all countries, and as high as 74% and 80% in France and Denmark, respectively. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our analysis found a shift in use of endocrine therapy from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors. This trend is consistent with major clinical guidelines endorsing preferential use of aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women. Stabilization or small increase in tamoxifen use in the recent years may reflect the recognition of tamoxifen as still an appropriate first-line treatment. The similarity in utilization patterns may be due to the relatively comparable healthcare systems in the countries, namely universal health insurance and pharmaceutical coverage. Differences in utilization observed could be due to differences in breast cancer incidence, prescribing behaviours, interpretation of new trial evidence, and timing of drug marketing approval and reimbursement between countries.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacy and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Anal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment with often complex interventions. Little is known regarding the associated costs and resource use. METHODS: Patient records were extracted from a national hospital database to estimate the number of patients treated for anal cancer in England. Identified resource use was linked to published UK cost estimates to quantify the reimbursement of treatment through the Payment by Results system. A mathematical model was developed simultaneously to validate findings and to calculate the average 10-year cost of treating a squamous cell anal carcinoma case from diagnosis. The model utilised data from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland's anal cancer position statement. RESULTS: On average, 1,564 patients were admitted to hospital and 389 attended an outpatient facility per year. The average annual cost per inpatient and outpatient ranged from £4,562-£5,230 and £1,146-£1,335, respectively. Based on the model estimates, the inflated cost per case was between £16,470-£16,652. Results were most sensitive to the mode of admission for primary treatment and the costs of staging/diagnosis (inflated range: £14,309-£23,264). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations in the available data, these results indicate that the cost of treating anal cancer is significant. Further observational work is required in order to verify these findings.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC public health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","uri":{"id":"D002294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Statistics as Topic","uri":{"id":"D013223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anus Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001005","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Great Britain","uri":{"id":"D006113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Theoretical","uri":{"id":"D008962","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inpatients","uri":{"id":"D007297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mathematics","uri":{"id":"D008433","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outpatients","uri":{"id":"D010045","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"England","uri":{"id":"D004739","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ireland","uri":{"id":"D007494","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25361522","title":"The cost of anal cancer in England: retrospective hospital data analysis and Markov model.","year":"2014"}

We designed and modified the guidelines for each focus group discussion through repeated review and discussion among all authors and then we conducted the groups with a professional interviewer at Gallup Korea. After the focus groups we analyzed the verbatim transcriptions to identify specific meanings and potential implications.ResultsFrom the study we identified that the patients and physicians did not have a correct understanding about the role of primary care. We also identified a significant discrepancy between their perception of primary care. In particular, the patient group perceived the quality of primary care to be poor and unsatisfactory while the physician group perceived the quality of primary care to be better in Korea than in other countries.ConclusionsThe focus group discussions revealed that such discrepancies in perception have resulted from Korea¿s distorted healthcare delivery system, undifferentiated roles among healthcare organizations, patients¿ freedom of choice in selecting healthcare providers and other institutional factors. There are several steps that should be taken to promote primary care in Korea. First, we should undertake efforts to improve the quality of primary care provided by physicians. Second, we should inform the general public about using clinics instead of hospitals for the treatment of simple or minor diseases. Third, we should introduce a new compensation scheme to compensate physicians for services related to health education, disease prevention, behavioral change and nutrition consultation.

However, physicians are often concerned about the impact that such communications will have on their time, productivity, and reimbursement. Typically, physicians are not reimbursed for time spent communicating with patients electronically. But under federal meaningful-use criteria for information technology, physicians can receive a modest incentive for such communications. Little is known about trends in secure e-mail messaging between physicians and patients. To understand these trends, we analyzed the volume of messages in a large academic health system's patient portal in the period 2001-10. At the end of 2010, 49,778 patients (22.7 percent of all patients seen within the system) had enrolled in the portal, and 36.9 percent of enrolled patients (8.4 percent of all patients) had sent at least one message to a physician. Physicians in the aggregate saw a near tripling of e-mail messages during the study period. However, the number of messages per hundred patients per month stabilized between 2005 and 2010, at an average of 18.9 messages. As physician reimbursement moves toward global payments, physicians' and patients' participation in secure messaging will likely increase, and electronic communication should be considered part of physicians' job descriptions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health affairs (Project Hope)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Portal System","uri":{"id":"D011168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Job Description","uri":{"id":"D007587","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Participation","uri":{"id":"D010358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronics","uri":{"id":"D004581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrons","uri":{"id":"D004583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronic Mail","uri":{"id":"D034742","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communism","uri":{"id":"D003148","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25288428","title":"Patient-to-physician messaging: volume nearly tripled as more patients joined system, but per capita rate plateaued.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"AIM: Diabetes is a growing burden especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Inadequate access to diabetes care is of particular concern and selection of appropriate diabetes medicines on national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) is a first step in achieving adequate access. This selection was studied among LMICs and influences of various factors associated with selection decisions were assessed. METHODS: Countries were studied if they employed NEMLs for reimbursement or procurement purposes. Presence and number of essential diabetes medicines from different classes, both insulins and oral blood glucose lowering medicines, were surveyed and calculated. Data were also analyzed by country income level, geographic region, year of last update of the NEML and purpose of NEML employment. The effect of prevalence and burden of disease on the number of essential diabetes medicines was also studied. Non parametric tests and univariate linear regression analysis were used. RESULTS: Nearly all countries (n = 32) had chosen fast (97%) and intermediate acting insulin (93%), glibenclamide and metformin (100% both) as essential medicines. The median number of essential diabetes medicines was 6, equally divided between insulins and oral medicines. 20% of the countries had selected insulin analogues as essential medicines. Among all the studied factors, an increase in burden of diabetes and wealth of countries were associated with selection of higher numbers of essential diabetes medicines (p = 0.02 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all the studied LMICs had included the minimum required medicines for diabetes management in their NEMLs.

However, the current relative decrease in reimbursement of effective psychotherapy approaches occurring in the context of an increase in prescription of psychotropic medication lacks a scientific base. Using psychodynamic psychotherapy as an example, we review the literature on meta-analyses and recent outcome studies of effective treatment approaches. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is an effective treatment for a wide variety of mental disorders. Adding to the known effectiveness of other shorter treatments, the results indicate lasting change in many cases, especially for complex and difficult to treat patients, ultimately reducing health-care utilization. Research-informed health care decisions that take into account the solid evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapy, including psychodynamic psychotherapy, have the potential to promote choice, increase mental health, and reduce society's burden of disease in the long run.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Psychodynamic psychiatry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotherapy, Psychodynamic","uri":{"id":"D064889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Disorders","uri":{"id":"D001523","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotherapy, Psychodynamic","uri":{"id":"D064889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Politics","uri":{"id":"D011057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prescriptions","uri":{"id":"D055656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intelligence","uri":{"id":"D007360","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011613","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25211431","title":"The efficacy of psychotherapy: focus on psychodynamic psychotherapy as an example.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a multidisciplinary warfarin safety intervention on objective quality measurements. DESIGN: A pre-post comparison of aggregate performance following 12 months of intervention activities. SETTING: Long-term care facilities. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Twelve long-term care facilities in New York state. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included serial data reports, pharmacy alerts, quality improvement meetings, and Webinars. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of residents receiving anticoagulation therapy and who were receiving timely International Normalized Ratio (INR) testing following initiation of an interacting antibiotic. Secondary outcomes included: time in therapeutic range (TTR), mean INR, mean time between INRs, proportion of INR values between 2.3 and 2.7, and the frequency of INR \"excursions.\" RESULTS: Baseline analysis of the three-month preintervention period identified 207 warfarin-antibiotic coprescribing events, with only 70% being followed by a timely INR test. The baseline TTR was 45.49%, and the mean INR was 2.32. Baseline evaluations of facility policies and procedures identified process gaps in dosing and monitoring of warfarin. Intervention significantly improved the timeliness of INR monitoring (79.6%; P=0.03), but secondary measures were not measurably improved. Facility adherence to intervention implementation was poor, diminishing study impact. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation management was suboptimal at baseline, and improvements were not seen despite repeated attempts to implement a structured, sequential intervention. Long-term care facilities may be unwilling or unable to voluntarily implement known best practices for anticoagulation management, suggesting that changes to regulations and reimbursement systems may be warranted.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Consultant pharmacist : the journal of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Long-Term Care","uri":{"id":"D008134","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Design","uri":{"id":"D012107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Improvement","uri":{"id":"D058996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"New York","uri":{"id":"D009518","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Practice Guidelines as Topic","uri":{"id":"D017410","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Normalized Ratio","uri":{"id":"D019934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Bacterial Agents","uri":{"id":"D000900","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internship and Residency","uri":{"id":"D007396","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacies","uri":{"id":"D010594","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacy","uri":{"id":"D010604","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Warfarin","uri":{"id":"D014859","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Normalized Ratio","uri":{"id":"D019934","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25203106","title":"Improving warfarin safety in long-term care.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"STUDY QUESTION: What is the safe and pharmacodynamically active dose range for PDC31 (prostaglandin F2α receptor inhibitor) in patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD)? SUMMARY ANSWER: The 1 mg/kg/h dose of PDC31 appears to be safe and potentially effective in reducing intrauterine pressure (IUP) and pain associated with excessive uterine contractility when given as a 3-h infusion in patients with PD. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PDC31 has previously been shown to reduce the duration and strength of PGF2α-induced contractions in human uterine myometrial strip models and to delay delivery in animal models of preterm labor. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a prospective, multi-center, dose-escalating first-in-human Phase I study conducted from March 2011 to June 2012. A total of 24 women with PD were enrolled and treated with one of five doses (0.01, 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/h) of PDC31 given as a 3-h infusion. Patients were observed for a further 24 h. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This study was conducted at four hospitals in Europe in non-pregnant, menstruating women with PD. Women with PD (n = 24) received PDC31 infused over 3 h within 8-10 h of the onset of menstruation. IUP and pain monitoring through the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed prior to, during and following the infusion. Patients were observed for dose-limiting toxicities and other adverse events. Pharmacokinetic samples were also taken to profile the drug. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A 3-h infusion of PDC31 was safe up to and including doses of 1 mg/kg/h. Most adverse events were mild (n = 15; 83.3%) and not considered associated with PDC31 (n = 14; 77.8%). PDC31 infusion decreased uterine activity based on IUP and pain (VAS) scores. IUP was decreased by 23% over all dose levels, reaching a minimum at 135-150 min. There appeared to be a dose-dependent effect on IUP, with the high dose group (1 mg/kg/h) showing the largest decrease in IUP. There was a statistically significant linear dose-effect and concentration-effect relationship for several IUP parameters over the evaluation period of 60-180 min. A dose differentiating effect on pain was seen with the two highest doses. PDC31 demonstrated uncomplicated, linear pharmacokinetics with a terminal half-life of ∼2 h. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This was a first-in-human study and exposure to PDC31 was limited for safety reasons. As such, pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed at a two-sided Type I error of 20%, an appropriate level for the exploratory nature of this study without a placebo control arm. This limited the chance of false positive findings to one in five. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Like PD, preterm labor is associated with prostaglandin-mediated uterine contractions; therefore, the findings of this study support further development of PDC31 as a treatment for both PD and preterm labor.

It affects 1 in every 300-1000 live births with a male to female ratio of 5:1. Most of the patients present in their first year of life. During the teenage years, patients may have exercise intolerance and psychological strain because of their chest wall deformity. The Nuss and Ravitch procedures are established methods of surgical correction of PE. An index of severity known best as the Haller index, typically evaluated with computed tomography scan, when measuring greater than 3.2 is considered to indicate moderate or severe PE and is a prerequisite for third-party insurance reimbursement for these corrective procedures. This article reviews the clinical features of PE, the role of imaging, and the opportunities for radiation dose reduction.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thoracic Wall","uri":{"id":"D035441","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Live Birth","uri":{"id":"D050498","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Congenital Abnormalities","uri":{"id":"D000013","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiation","uri":{"id":"D011827","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tomography","uri":{"id":"D014054","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise","uri":{"id":"D015444","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Funnel Chest","uri":{"id":"D005660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25129214","title":"Pectus excavatum: current imaging techniques and opportunities for dose reduction.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"STUDY QUESTION: What changes can be detected in fertility preservation (FP) counselling (FPC) over time and what are the determinants associated with the referral of newly diagnosed female cancer patients, aged 0-39 years, to a specialist in reproductive medicine for FPC? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although the absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time, only 9.8% of all potential patients (aged 0-39 years) were referred in 2011 and referral disparities were found with respect to patients' age, cancer diagnosis and healthcare provider-related factors. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Referral rates for FPC prior to the start of gonadotoxic cancer treatment are low. Determinants associated with low referral and referral disparities have been identified in previous studies, although there are only scarce data on referral practices and determinants for FPC referral in settings with reimbursement of FP(C). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a retrospective observational and questionnaire study in a Dutch university hospital. Data on all female cancer patients counselled for FP in this centre (2001-2013), as well as all newly diagnosed female cancer patients aged 0-39 years in the region (2009-2011) were collected. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical records (FPC patients), cancer incidences reported by the Dutch Cancer Registry (to calculate referral percentages) and referring professionals (to identify reasons for the current referral behaviour). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 2011, a total of 9.8% of the patients were referred for FPC. Patients aged 20-29 years or diagnosed with breast cancer or lymphoma were referred more frequently compared with patients under the age of 20 years or patients diagnosed with other malignancies. The absolute numbers of patients receiving FPC increased over time. Healthcare provider-related determinants for low referral were not starting a discussion about fertility-related issues, not knowing where to refer a patient for FPC and not collaborating with patients' associations. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Actual referral rates may slightly differ from our estimation as there may have been patients who did not wish to receive FPC. Sporadically, patients might have been directly referred to other regions or may have received ovarian transposition without FPC. By excluding skin cancer patients, we will have underestimated the group of women who are eligible for FPC as this group also includes melanoma patients who might have received gonadotoxic therapy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The low referral rates and referral disparities reported in the current study indicate that there are opportunities to improve referral practices. Future research should focus on the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve referral practices, such as information materials for patients at oncology departments, discussion prompts or methods to increase the awareness of physicians and patients of FP techniques and guidelines.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The implementation of Medicare Part D provided insurance coverage for outpatient medications, but when persons reach the \"gap,\" they have very limited or no medication insurance coverage until they reach a second threshold for catastrophic coverage. In addition, some patients have a low-income subsidy (LIS), and their out-of-pocket costs do not reach the threshold for the gap. Little is known about how these Part D types (LIS versus non-LIS) and benefit phases (before the gap, during the gap, after the gap) affect medication adherence and persistence of dialysis patients.  OBJECTIVE: To examine medication use, adherence, and persistence for Medicare-eligible dialysis patients by Part D benefit type and benefit phase.  METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using data from the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) was conducted for Medicare-eligible dialysis patients. Outcomes included medication use, adherence, and persistence. Patients were categorized into 4 cohorts based on their Part D benefit phase that the beneficiaries reached at the end of the year and LIS receipt in 2007: Cohort 1 = non-LIS and did not reach the coverage gap; Cohort 2 = non-LIS and reached the coverage gap; Cohort 3 = non-LIS and reached catastrophic coverage after the gap; and Cohort 4 = received an LIS and none of the LIS patients reached the coverage gap. Outcomes were measured separately for 5 therapeutic classes of outpatient prescription drugs: antihyperglycemics, antihypertensives, antilipidemics, phosphate binders, and calcimimetics.  RESULTS: A total of 11,732 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Patients were distributed among the cohorts as follows: 3,678 (31.3%) patients in Cohort 1 who did not reach the coverage gap; 4,349 (37.1%) patients in Cohort 2 who reached the coverage gap but not catastrophic coverage; 1,310 (11.2%) patients in Cohort 3 who reached catastrophic coverage; and 2,395 (20.4%) patients in Cohort 4 who had an LIS (none of whom reached the gap). Overall, the percentage of patients who were adherent to their medications (≥ 80% medication possession ratio) was low: 39% for antihyperglycemics, 59% for antihypertensives, 54% for antilipidemics, 22% for phosphate binders, and 35% for cinacalcet. There were wide ranges in adherence rates depending on the cohort. For patients on antihyperglycemics, antihypertensives, antilipidemics, phosphate binders, and cinacalcet, the odds ratios for adherence to therapy were 0.76 (95% C I =0.63-0.92), 1.06 (0.94-1.19), 0.80 (0.67-0.95), 0.65 (0.55-0.76), and 0.39 (0.30-0.49), respectively; the hazard ratios for discontinuation of therapy were 1.18 (95% CI 1.06-1.31), 1.01 (0.93-1.10), 1.25 (1.12-1.40), 1.13 (1.05-1.21), and 1.61 (1.75-1.82), respectively, for Cohort 2 patients who reached the coverage gap compared with those in Cohort 4 who received an LIS. In addition, when comparing adherence before and after the benefit gap, patients in Cohort 2 were significantly more likely to be nonadherent to medications for diabetes (relative risk (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.48-1.99), hypertension (RR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.54-1.85), hyperlipidemia (RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.76-2.29), hyperphosphatemia (RR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.55-1.95), and hyperparathyroidism (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.66-2.60) after reaching the coverage gap.  CONCLUSIONS: More than half of Medicare beneficiaries on dialysis reached the Part D coverage gap in 2007. Our findings suggest that the Part D coverage gap was significantly associated with decreases in adherence and persistence for medications frequently used in patients undergoing dialysis. Patients who reached the coverage gap (Cohort 2) often decreased use of or discontinued critical medications after reaching the coverage gap. Compared with patients who had an LIS (Cohort 4), patients in Cohort 2 had significantly lower medication adherence and persistence levels. The negative impact of the Part D coverage gap (high out-of-pocket cost sharing) on medication adherence and persistence for Medicare-eligible dialysis patients has implications for currently proposed Medicare end-stage renal disease bundled reimbursement payment and requires more research.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of managed care pharmacy :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVES: General practitioners (GPs) in the UK may be commissioned to provide long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), which may have a role in reducing rates of abortion and unintended pregnancies. Primary care trusts (PCTs) in England had commissioning arrangements with GPs to provide LARC but little is known about such contractual arrangements. We studied the commissioning arrangements in some London PCTs to evaluate the cost and clinical governance of these contracts. METHODS: We requested commissioning contract specifications and activities for intrauterine contraception (IUC) and subdermal implants (SDI) from responsible officers in each PCT in London relating to activities in three financial years, namely 2009/2010 to 2011/2012. We evaluated each contract using a structure, process and outcome approach. RESULTS: Half (15/31) the PCTs responded and submitted 20 contracts used to commission their GPs to provide IUC, SDI or a combination of these with testing for sexually transmitted infections. The information regarding service activity was inadequate and inconsistent so had to be abandoned. Information from 20 contracts suggested there was a variation in clinical governance and quality assurance mechanisms; there was also a range in the reimbursement for IUC insertion (£77.50 to £105.00), SDI insertion (£25.00 to £81.31) and SDI removal (£30.00 to £100.00) at 2011 prices. CONCLUSION: It was not clear from non-responders if these PCTs had a service in place. Of those that did commission IUC and SDI services, some specifications were lacking in detail regarding aspects of clinical governance. New commissioners should make explicit references to quality and safety criteria as poor-quality specifications can give rise to serious untoward incidents and litigation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The journal of family planning and reproductive health care / Faculty of Family Planning & Reproductive Health Care, Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abortion, Induced","uri":{"id":"D000028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Information Services","uri":{"id":"D007255","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Clinical Governance","uri":{"id":"D054976","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Practitioners","uri":{"id":"D058005","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Contraception","uri":{"id":"D003267","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Trust","uri":{"id":"D035502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Commerce","uri":{"id":"D003132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"England","uri":{"id":"D004739","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Jurisprudence","uri":{"id":"D007603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"London","uri":{"id":"D008131","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25053152","title":"An evaluation of commissioning arrangements for intrauterine and subdermal contraception services from general practitioners in London, UK.","year":"2014"}

They are based on ancient Chinese medicine and have evolved to the Japanese original style over a long period of time. Ethical Kampo formulations are prescribed in general practice by physician under the National Health Insurance reimbursement system. Over-the-counter (OTC) Kampo formulations can be purchased and used for self-medication in primary health care settings. Kampo medicines have a substantial role in the Japanese healthcare system. In the early 1970s, \"The Internal Assignments on the Review for Approval of OTC Kampo Products\", known as \"210 OTC Kampo Formulae\", was published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (currently the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare). In 2008, \"210 OTC Kampo Formulae\" was revised and presented as \"The Approval Standards for OTC Kampo Products\" and now 294 Kampo formulae are listed in the standards. These products have had wide spread usage in Japan. Crude drugs and Kampo extracts have been listed in The Japanese Pharmacopoeia. Both The Approval Standards and The Quality Standards play a key role in regulation of Kampo products. \"Application Guideline for Western Traditional Herbal Medicines as OTC Drugs\" was published in 2007.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Homecare is an important and effective way of managing chronic illnesses using skilled nursing care in the home. Unlike hospitals and ambulatory settings, clinicians visit patients at home at different times, independent of each other. Twenty-nine percent of 10,000 homecare agencies in the United States have adopted point-of-care EHRs. Yet, relatively little is known about the growing use of homecare EHRs. OBJECTIVE: Researchers compared workflow, financial billing, and patient outcomes before and after implementation to evaluate the impact of a homecare point-of-care EHR. METHODS: The design was a pre/post observational study embedded in a mixed methods study. The setting was a Philadelphia-based homecare agency with 137 clinicians. Data sources included: (1) clinician EHR documentation completion; (2) EHR usage data; (3) Medicare billing data; (4) an EHR Nurse Satisfaction survey; (5) clinician observations; (6) clinician interviews; and (7) patient outcomes. RESULTS: Clinicians were satisfied with documentation timeliness and team communication. Following EHR implementation, 90% of notes were completed within the 1-day compliance interval (n = 56,702) compared with 30% of notes completed within the 7-day compliance interval in the pre-implementation period (n = 14,563; OR 19, p <. 001). Productivity in the number of clinical notes documented post-implementation increased almost 10-fold compared to pre-implementation. Days to Medicare claims fell from 100 days pre-implementation to 30 days post-implementation, while the census rose. EHR implementation impact on patient outcomes was limited to some behavioral outcomes. DISCUSSION: Findings from this homecare EHR study indicated clinician EHR use enabled a sustained increase in productivity of note completion, as well as timeliness of documentation and billing for reimbursement with limited impact on improving patient outcomes. As EHR adoption increases to better meet the needs of the growing population of older people with chronic health conditions, these results can inform homecare EHR development and implementation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Applied clinical informatics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chronic Disease","uri":{"id":"D002908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Care","uri":{"id":"D009732","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronic Health Records","uri":{"id":"D057286","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adoption","uri":{"id":"D000300","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compliance","uri":{"id":"D003187","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronics","uri":{"id":"D004581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrons","uri":{"id":"D004583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicare","uri":{"id":"D006278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workflow","uri":{"id":"D057188","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Documentation","uri":{"id":"D004282","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Satisfaction","uri":{"id":"D010549","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Censuses","uri":{"id":"D019352","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25024760","title":"Impact of homecare electronic health record on timeliness of clinical documentation, reimbursement, and patient outcomes.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE: (1) To describe change in treatment patterns for degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). (2) To report regional variation in treatment of DS. (3) To describe variation in surgeon-reported outcomes for DS based on treatment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal stenosis associated with DS is commonly treated with decompression and fusion but little is known about the optimal fusion technique. During a 6-month period, American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery step II candidates submit procedure lists; these lists have been stored in an electronic database since 1999. METHODS: The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database was retrospectively queried to identify patients who underwent surgery for DS from 1999 to 2011. Included patients underwent uninstrumented fusion, fusion with posterior instrumentation, fusion using interbody device, or decompression without fusion. Utilization of these procedures was analyzed by year and geographic region. RESULTS: The study period included 5639 cases; the annual number of cases doubled during the study period. The percentage of cases treated with interbody fusion (IF) increased significantly throughout the study period, from 13.6% (1999-2001) to 32% (2009-2011) (P<0.001). The percentage of DS cases treated with posterolateral fusion peaked in 2003 then decreased as the rate of IF increased. In 2011, the rates of posterolateral fusion (40%) and posterolateral fusion with IF (37%) were nearly identical. The Northwest had the highest rate of IF (41%), >10% higher than any other region (P<0.001) and more than 23% higher than the Southeast (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite little evidence guiding treatment strategy for DS, national treatment patterns have changed dramatically during the past 13 years. The rapid adoption of IF and substantial regional variation in treatment utilization patterns raises questions about drivers of change including perceptions about associated fusion rates, the importance of sagittal balance and differential reimbursement.

In parallel with this trend, the purchasers of health care are slowly shifting the reimbursement paradigm from one based on rewarding transactions, or work performed, to one that rewards value delivered. Within this context, the health-care value equation is broadly defined as quality divided by costs. Health information technology has been widely recognized as 1 of the foundations for delivering better care at lower costs. As the largest purchaser of health care in the world, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has deployed a series of interrelated programs designed to spur the adoption and utilization of health information technology. This review examines our known collective experience in the practice of nephrology to date with several of these programs and attempts to answer the following question: Is health information technology helping or hindering the delivery of value to the nation's health-care system? Through this review, it was concluded overall that the effect of health information technology appears positive; however, it cannot be objectively determined because of the infancy of its utilization in the practice of medicine.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in chronic kidney disease","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomedical Technology","uri":{"id":"D020811","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)","uri":{"id":"D014487","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medical Informatics","uri":{"id":"D008490","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adoption","uri":{"id":"D000300","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Foundations","uri":{"id":"D005582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicare","uri":{"id":"D006278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reward","uri":{"id":"D012201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nephrology","uri":{"id":"D009398","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24969389","title":"Health information technology: help or hindrance?","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Code stroke systems are widely implemented to expedite acute stroke treatment. Although this system requires considerable resources, so far no reimbursement has been provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in Taiwan. We investigated how often a code stroke was initiated and the percentage of patients treated with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator, and draw attention to the resulting mismatch. METHODS: From January 2010 to September 2011, we prospectively registered all consecutive code stroke patients. Patient characteristics, including demographic data, medical history, comorbidity conditions, treatments, and discharge diagnosis were collected, together with the exact time of onset (or last known normal time) and management. The eligibility of thrombolysis for each patient recorded originally on the chart was reviewed retrospectively on the basis of two sets of criteria, namely, the BNHI reimbursement criteria and the Taiwan Stroke Society (TSS) guideline. RESULTS: During the study period, code strokes were activated for 419 patients at an average of around 20 patients per month. About 57% of code strokes were initiated outside of office hours. Stroke was diagnosed in 377 (90%) patients and 304 (73%) patients had ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 42 (10%) patients according to the BNHI reimbursement criteria and 101 (24%) patients by the TSS guideline were eligible for IV thrombolytic therapy. Of all the code stroke patients, only 49 (12%) were actually treated. Before each additional patient was thrombolysed, about eight patients had been evaluated and excluded from treatment. CONCLUSION: The majority of code stroke patients were stroke patients; however, most of them could not be treated with thrombolytic therapy. These findings underscore the need for further support from the BNHI in order for health-care providers to implement the code stroke systems successfully.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Personnel","uri":{"id":"D006282","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Health Programs","uri":{"id":"D009313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stroke","uri":{"id":"D020521","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ischemic Attack, Transient","uri":{"id":"D002546","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Health","uri":{"id":"D007348","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Plasminogen Activator","uri":{"id":"D010959","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plasminogen Activators","uri":{"id":"D010960","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thrombolytic Therapy","uri":{"id":"D015912","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plasminogen","uri":{"id":"D010958","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Taiwan","uri":{"id":"D013624","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comorbidity","uri":{"id":"D015897","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24961186","title":"Code stroke: a mismatch between number of activation and number of thrombolysis.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: There are potential conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially where there are effectiveness, safety and/or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies showed dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. These concerns resulted in extensive activities pre- to post-launch to manage its introduction. OBJECTIVE: To (i) review authority activities across countries, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications based on post-launch activities. METHODOLOGY: (i) Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran, (ii) development of guidance for key stakeholder groups through an iterative process, (iii) refining guidance following post launch studies. RESULTS: Plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, centering on three pillars of pre-, peri-, and post-launch activities. Post-launch activities include increasing use of patient registries to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Models for introducing new drugs are essential to optimize their prescribing especially where concerns. Without such models, new drugs may be withdrawn prematurely and/or struggle for funding.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in pharmacology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Design","uri":{"id":"D015195","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drugs, Essential","uri":{"id":"D018954","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atrial Fibrillation","uri":{"id":"D001281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hemorrhage","uri":{"id":"D006470","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Registries","uri":{"id":"D012042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anticoagulants","uri":{"id":"D000925","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antidotes","uri":{"id":"D000931","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Budgets","uri":{"id":"D002017","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24959145","title":"Dabigatran - a continuing exemplar case history demonstrating the need for comprehensive models to optimize the utilization of new drugs.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Inpatient satisfaction is a key element of hospital pay-for-performance programs. Communication and pain management are known to influence results, but additional factors may affect satisfaction scores. We tested the hypothesis that patient factors and outcome parameters not considered previously are clinically important drivers of inpatient satisfaction. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 1,340 surgical patients who returned nationally standardized inpatient satisfaction questionnaires. These patients were managed by 41 surgeons in seven specialties at two academic medical centers. Thirty-two parameters based on the patient, surgeon, outcomes, and survey were measured. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: Inpatients rated their overall experience favorably 75.7% of the time. Less-satisfied patients were more likely to be female, younger, less ill, taking outpatient narcotics, and admitted via the emergency department (all P < .02). Less-satisfied patients also were more likely to have unresected cancer (P < .001) or a postoperative complication (P < .001). The most relevant independent predictors of dissatisfaction in multivariable analyses were younger age, admission via the emergency department, preoperative narcotic use, lesser severity of illness, unresected cancer, and postoperative morbidity (all P < .01). CONCLUSION: Several patient factors, expectations of patients with cancer, and postoperative complications are important and clinically relevant drivers of surgical inpatient satisfaction. Programs to manage expectations of cancer patient expectations and decrease postoperative morbidity should improve surgical inpatient satisfaction. Further efforts to risk-adjust patient satisfaction scores should be undertaken.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Surgery","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emergency

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians. METHODS: Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into \"information loss,\" \"overlapping categories,\" \"inconsistent,\" and \"consistent.\" Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Pediatrics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Classification of Diseases","uri":{"id":"D038801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Specialization","uri":{"id":"D013038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Illinois","uri":{"id":"D007087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Classification of Diseases","uri":{"id":"D038801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Illinois","uri":{"id":"D007087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pediatrics","uri":{"id":"D010372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reimbursement Mechanisms","uri":{"id":"D012051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Classification of Diseases","uri":{"id":"D038801","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Illinois","International Classification of Diseases","Medicaid","Pediatrics","Reimbursement Mechanisms","United States"]},"pmid":"24918217","title":"The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: Nearly all state Medicaid programs reimburse nondental primary care providers (PCPs) for providing preventive oral health services to young children; yet, little is known about how treatment outcomes compare with children visiting dentists. This study compared the association between the provider of preventive services (PCP, dentist, or both) with Medicaid-enrolled children before their third birthday and subsequent dental caries-related treatment (CRT) and CRT payment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of young children enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid during 2000 to 2006. The annual number of CRT and CRT payments per child between the ages of 3 and 5 yr were estimated with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression and a hurdle model, respectively. Models were adjusted for relevant child- and county-level characteristics and used propensity score weighting to address observed confounding. RESULTS: We examined 41,453 children with > 1 preventive oral health visit from a PCP, dentist, or both before their third birthday. Unadjusted annual mean CRT and payments were lowest among children who had only PCP visits (CRT = 0.87, payment = $172) and higher among children with only dentist visits (CRT = 1.48, payment = $234) and both PCP and dentist visits (CRT = 1.52, payment = $273). Adjusted results indicated that children who had dentist visits (with or without PCP visits) had significantly more CRT and higher CRT payments per year during the ages of 3 and 4 yr than children who had only PCP visits.

CONCLUSIONS: Because of children's increased opportunity to receive multiple visits in medical offices during well-child visits, preventive oral health services provided by PCPs may lead to a greater reduction in CRT than dentist visits alone.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) anticipates that insurance expansion will increase safety-net hospitals' revenues and will reduce DSH payments accordingly. We examined the impact of the ACA's Medicaid DSH reductions on California public hospitals' financial stability by estimating how total DSH costs (uncompensated care costs and Medicaid shortfalls) will change as a result of insurance expansion and the offsetting DSH reductions. Decreases in uncompensated care costs resulting from the ACA insurance expansion may not match the act's DSH reductions because of the high number of people who will remain uninsured, low Medicaid reimbursement rates, and medical cost inflation. Taking these three factors into account, we estimate that California public hospitals' total DSH costs will increase from $2.044 billion in 2010 to $2.363-$2.503 billion in 2019, with unmet DSH costs of $1.381-$1.537 billion.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health affairs (Project Hope)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals, Public","uri":{"id":"D006779","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uncompensated Care","uri":{"id":"D017664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","uri":{"id":"D058991","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety-net Providers","uri":{"id":"D064876","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"California","uri":{"id":"D002140","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medically Uninsured","uri":{"id":"D017057","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24889948","title":"Disproportionate-share hospital payment reductions may threaten the financial stability of safety-net hospitals.","year":"2014"}

As a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will reduce home health payments 3.5 percent per year in the period 2014-17. To determine the impact that these reductions could have on beneficiaries using home health care, we examined the Medicare reimbursement margins and the use of services in a national sample of 96,621 episodes of care provided by twenty-six not-for-profit home health agencies in 2011. We found that patients with clinically complex conditions and social vulnerability factors, such as living alone, had substantially higher service delivery costs than other home health patients. Thus, the socially vulnerable patients with complex conditions represent less profit-lower-to-negative Medicare margins-for home health agencies. This financial disincentive could reduce such patients' access to care as Medicare payments decline.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Between April 2010 and January 2013 a total of 100 patients who were diagnosed as temporomandibular joint disorder in the Department of Otolaryngology at Bozok University School of Medicine were prospectively studied. Patients with symptoms of jaw pain, limited or painful jaw movement, clicking or grating within the joint, were evaluated with temporomandibular CT to investigate the presence of cartilage or capsule degeneration. In the study group there were 55 female and 45 male patients who were non-responders to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment for TMJ complaints. The patients were randomly divided into four groups consisting of a control group and three different groups who underwent intra-articular injection of one given anti-inflammatory agent for each group. We injected saline solution to intra-articular space in the control group. Of three anti-inflammatory agents including hyaluronic acid (HA, Hyalgan intra-articular injection, Sodium hyaluronate 10 mg/ml, 2 ml injection syringe, Bilim Pharmaceutical Company, Istanbul, Turkey); betamethasone (CS, Diprospan flacon, 7.0 mg betamethasone/1 ml, Schering-Plough Pharmaceutical Company, Istanbul, Turkey) and; tenoxicam (TX, Tilcotil flacon, 20 mg tenoxicam/ml, Roche Pharmaceutical Company, Istanbul, Turkey) were administered intra-articularly under, ultrasonographic guidance. Following the completion of injections the, changes in subjective symptoms were compared with visual analogue scales, (VAS) scores at 1st and 6th weeks' follow-up visits between four groups. RESULTS: The HA group did significantly better pain relief scores compared to the, other groups at 1st and 6th weeks (p < 0.05). TX and CS groups' pain scores were better than control group values (p < 0.05, for both agents). The pain relief effect of TX was noted to decrease significantly between the 1st and 6th week (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). We did not observe the same pattern in HA, CS and control (saline) groups between 1st and 6th week (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We found that HA produced better pain relief scores when compared to the other anti-inflammatory agents studied. The main disadvantage of HA is its relatively higher cost. Additionally it does not have a reimbursement status by state or private health insurance systems in Turkey. Despite the lower VAS scores, intra-articular TX and CS may be assessed as more economic alternatives to intra-articular HA injections.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The transfusion efficacy of ATK, which contain fully functional platelets, is beyond all doubt. The equivalence of ATK and PTK has been subject of many studies. Some of those studies show the superiority of ATK's, while others do not, but there have been no studies that demonstrated a superiority of PTK's. The superiority of platelets stored in plasma and in third generation additive solution was demonstrated in clinical studies; therefore, it cannot be said that all the platelet concentrates on the German market are equivalent in efficacy. Of decisive importance, above all, is the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections with known pathogens, or those not yet discovered. This risk is different for ATK compared to PTK. Taking this difference in risk and the difference in donor exposure of transfused patients into account, it can definitely be said that ATK and PTK are not equivalent. In 2012, the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) published a mathematical risk model for different platelet concentrates and assessed the risk of transmitting known pathogens such as HIV, HCV, and HBV. The risk was higher for PTK compared to ATK. The relative risks for PTK derived from 4BCs were 2.2 (95%--CI: 2.1-2.4) for HIV, 2.7 (95%--CI: 2.5-3.0) for HCV, and 2.2 (95%--CI: 2.8-3.7) for HBV. At the present time, these are the relative risks of transfusion-transmitted infections with the traditional pathogens for PTK compared to ATK. In addition to the RKI assessed risks, there is the theoretical risk of a new, unknown agent, transmitted through blood exposure. The magnitude of this risk is hardly predictable for PTK. The experience gathered so far, especially in the last three decades, with the emergence of HIV, prions, and West Nil virus, shows that the biological nature of a next transfusion-transmissible infectious agent cannot be predictable. This agent, if we think at a conventional sexually transmissible agent with nucleic acid and long latent period, would spread first in areas with high population density and thereby reduce the theoretical advantage of ATK (but definitely would not nullify it!). It is equally plausible, however, that this agent would behave like a prion, non-sexual transmission, or like a West-Nil virus, a non-contagious vector-transmitted agent. For PTK this would mean a relative risk up to 4 times (PTK from 4 BCs) or 5 times (PTK from 5 BCs) higher than the risk estimated by the Robert-Koch-Institute. If, taking the passive surveillance data and the changing variables (donor frequency, donor population, and donor location) into account, the risk of transmission of an infection via ATK (exposure to 1 donor) with HIV, HCV, and HBV moves closer to the higher risk of PTK (exposure to 4 or 8 donors, in case of double ATK per patient), this result of the risk model calculation by no means indicates any equivalency between PTK and ATK with respect to the risk of transmission of infection. The modifiable variables of donor frequency, donor population, and donor location need to be modified, as scientific deductions, in such a way that the avoidable risk of ATK which is influenced by these variables can be corrected to the minimum risk of a transmission of infection of HIV, HBV, and HCV via ATK in comparison to PTK. The minimum risk of a possible transmission of infection via ATK (exposure to 1 donor) is the basic intrinsic risk of each individual blood donation. The basic intrinsic risk increases relative to the number of blood donations or exposure to donors (PtK has an unalterable, production-dependent exposure to 4 or 8 donors). Let us consider a 1:1.000 prevalence for a new pathogen, which is spread equally in each donor population (apheresis and whole blood) and the present case of approximately 500,000 transfused platelet concentrates in Germany. This means that for the production of 4 PTK about 2 million donations are processed, 2,000 infectious Buffy-Coats are obtained and, thereby, 2,000 infectious PTK. In the case of ATK, considering five (5) donations per year, theoretically, it would mean 100 donors infected and 500 infectious ATK. Considering 15 apheresis donations per donor per year, this would mean that 33 donors are infected, but still 500 infectious ATK would be produced. The prion is an example of a pathogen that, although its existence is well known, cannot be proven or pathogen-reduced. In addition, it has a very long incubation period compared to the donation intervals. Due to the manufacturing process, PTK has a 4-fold higher donor exposure and therefore a 4-fold higher risk for transfusion-transmitted infections compared to ATK. If a patient needs the transfusion of two platelet concentrates, by transfusing a double-ATK from the same donor the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections will remain the same. On the other hand, the risk will increase by 8-fold by transfusing two PTK. The only current possibility to prevent or to minimize the risk of infection with prions is to minimize the donor exposure by transfusing ATK instead of PTK. Hypothetical risk scenarios carry significant weight in law. This can be seen in the constant rulings of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshofs (BGH)) on the so-called hypothetical risk explanations (BGH, NJW 1996, 776, 777; 2000, 1784, 1787; 2005, 2614, 2616). Therefore, a risk does not need to be confirmed to be subject to compulsory explanation. It is sufficient that serious voices in the medical scientific community point to specific risks, which cannot be set aside as insignificant outside opinions, but must be viewed as serious warnings. According to the rulings, patients must even be informed of rare and often extremely rare risks, which could, should they come true, significantly impact daily life and, despite their rarity, are specific to the treatment and are startling for the ordinary person (BGH, 15.02.2000- VI ZR 48199 -; BGH, 30.11.2004 - VI ZR 209104 -; OLG Hamm, 29.09.2010 - 1-3 V 169109). These conditions have been fulfilled for PTK according to current knowledge, especially since, in the meantime in several rulings, the federal supreme court has required the reference to as yet unknown risks (refer to BGH, 13.06.2006 - VI ZR 323104 - for the use of new medical treatment methods, BGH, 27.06.2007 - VI ZR 55105 for experimental therapy using new, unapproved medication BGH, 06.07.2010 - VI ZR 198109 - for unknown risks cannot be excluded, for example based on anatomical conditions). ATK and PTK are therapeutic alternatives with the same range of indications for treatment using thrombocytes, however, with differing risks of infection, with different exposures to donors, and with different efficacy. ATK and PTK. ATK and PTK are therapeutic alternatives in terms of pharmaceutical law based on the different risks and the different quality. Patients must be informed of therapeutic alternatives such as ATK and PTK according to the patient rights law. Denial of reimbursement for additional fees for ATK by individual insurance companies (or paying authorities) deviates blatantly, as seen in the ruling of the Social Court of of the Saarland in this matter, from the basic requirement of the Transfusion Law (Transfusionsgesetz (TFG)) and is legally incorrect. The legality of the question whether the transfusion of ATK is indicated or if PTK had sufficed, is not allowable within the context of an MDK-Test according to subsection 275 ff. SGB V. The denial is a direct infringment on the treatment authority of the attending hospital physician and is illegal according to subsection 275 Abs. 5 SGBV. It is certainly possible to establish a full ATK supply and can be immediately realized by increasing donation rates from 5 to 8.3 apheresis donations per year in the current scenario of apheresis structure and donor population. The donation interval between two apheresis donations would be 49 days. A complete supply with ATK can also be immediately implemented by enlarging the donor population, keeping the current apheresis donation frequency. The donor pool must be increased by 24,576 donors, which means a 67% increase of the existing donor population. A transition to an ATK supply that can cover the entire demand can certainly be realized in a short period of time, while assuring a complete supply with PTK is not a realistic option. All existing studies advise taking extreme caution with any alternative to the current German gold standard for the treatment of hyporegenerative thrombocytopenia. A prophylactic transfusion of a non-pathogen-inactivated platelet concentrate with on average 3 x 10(11) platelets is recommended when the platelet count drops below the threshold of 10,000/microL. All other alternatives to this strategy show an increase in intracranial bleeding events. The existing studies on platelet dose (PLADO-Trial and StoP-Trial) do not recommend deviating from 3 x 10(11) platelets per unit. On the contrary, these studies demonstrate that the only practicable way is to individually correlate every platelet transfusion to the patient body surface. Considering the current knowledge, it is not justified to lower the standard dose and, for certain patient groups, to switch from prophylaxis to therapeutic platelet transfusion. Applying ATK or PTK with a lower platelet content and only for therapeutic purposes, could considerably increase the bleeding risk, especially for WHO grades III and IV. This will also affect all the patients who receive an induction treatment. Through pathogen reduction, in parallel with platelet loss (Apoptosis), the function of the treated platelets is impaired. Alternatively, the cell destruction caused during this process could result in a release of platelet microRNA directly into the supernatant or in microvesicles. This reduction of microRNA will affect the storage of the platelets.

Similar to recall appointments in many other medical settings, dental check-up examinations are an essential element of regular treatment. Check-ups are important for ensuring good health but their frequent consumption also implies substantial aggregate health care costs. Although it is crucial to determine appropriate utilization amounts, little is known about the role of financial incentives for both patient and provider. Our analyses relied on ten-year administrative panel data from the Scottish National Health Service including about 1.3 million dental treatment claims which were issued between January 1998 and September 2007. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we estimated a series of fixed-effects models to identify the impact of changes in provider payment and patients' cost sharing on check-up utilization. A significantly higher utilization of examinations was observed if dentists were paid fee-for service compared with salary. Comparably little variation in check-up use was attributable to different extents of patient co-payment. These findings establish that different provider payment methods have a substantial impact on check-up utilization. Because recall appointments in many other medical settings have similar features as dental check-ups, these findings may be relevant for health care decision makers who seek to optimize incentive schemes for all kinds of health care.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Social science & medicine (1982)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services","uri":{"id":"D006296","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Health Programs","uri":{"id":"D009313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Benefits","uri":{"id":"D007342","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cost Sharing","uri":{"id":"D017047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dentists","uri":{"id":"D003815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Salaries and Fringe Benefits","uri":{"id":"D012456","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tooth","uri":{"id":"D014070","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tooth Eruption","uri":{"id":"D014078","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24769490","title":"Provider payment bares teeth: dentist reimbursement and the use of check-up examinations.","year":"2014"}

STUDY SELECTION: Studies published since January 1990 and published in English that looked at barriers, experienced by dentists, to delivering oral health care to people over the age of 65 were included. Study quality was assessed independently using criteria developed by the Dutch Cochrane Centre. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two reviewers and a qualitative summary presented. RESULTS: Seven cross-sectional studies were included. The focus was primarily on dentists delivering oral health care to older people in care homes with only one focused on barriers experienced by dentists working in their own practice and delivering oral health care to community-dwelling older people. The most common barriers to delivering oral health care to older people were identified respectively as: the lack of adequate equipment in a care home and no area for treatment available (n = 4) and the lack of adequate reimbursement for working in a care home (n = 5). In addition, the inadequate training and experience in delivering oral health care to older care home residents (n = 2) were mentioned. Four publications indicated the loss of time from private practice as a barrier to delivering oral health care in a care home. CONCLUSIONS: Most articles retrieved described barriers experienced by dentists delivering oral health in care homes: much less is known about oral health care for community-dwelling older people. Therefore, we suggest that additional research should be initiated to investigate in more detail the barriers dentists experience in delivering oral health care to older people in their own dental practices.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Evidence-based dentistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24763169","title":"Barriers to providing dental care for older people.","year":"2014"}

However, little is known about their attitudes, knowledge, and perceived success, as well as about factors associated with the implementation of PA counseling. METHODS: We collected data from 4,074 PCPs including information on physician and practice characteristics, attitudes towards cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, and measures used during routine practice to prevent CVD. Here, we followed widely the established 5 A's strategy (Assess-Advise-Agree-Assist-Arrange). RESULTS: The majority (87.2%) of PCPs rated their own level of competence in PA counseling as 'high', while 52.3% rated their own capability to motivate patients to increase PA as 'not good'. Nine of ten PCPs routinely provided at least one measure of the modified 5 A's strategy, while 9.5% routinely used all five intervention strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The positive attitude towards PA counseling among PCPs should be supported by other stakeholders in the field of prevention and health promotion. An example would be the reimbursement of health counseling services by compulsory health insurance, which would enable PCPs to invest more time in individualized health promotion.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of physical activity & health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24762394","title":"Physical Activity Counseling by Primary Care Physicians: Attitudes, Knowledge, Implementation, and Perceived Success.","year":"2014"}

However, little is known about their practical, day-to-day experiences with pain medication management. OBJECTIVE: To describe day-to-day pain medication management from the perspectives of oncology outpatients and their family caregivers who participated in a randomized clinical trial of a psycho-educational intervention called the Pro-Self(©) Plus Pain Control Program. In this article, we focus on pain medication management by patients and family caregivers in the context of multiple, complex health systems. METHODS: We qualitatively analyzed audio-recorded intervention sessions that included extensive dialogue between patients, family caregivers, and nurses about pain medication management during the 10-week intervention. RESULTS: The health systems context for pain medication management included multiple complex systems for clinical care, reimbursement, and regulation of analgesic prescriptions. Pain medication management processes particularly relevant to this context were getting prescriptions and obtaining medications. Responsibilities that fell primarily to patients and family caregivers included facilitating communication and coordination among multiple clinicians, overcoming barriers to access, and serving as a final safety checkpoint. Significant effort was required of patients and family caregivers to insure safe and effective pain medication management. CONCLUSION: Health systems issues related to access to needed analgesics, medication safety in outpatient settings, and the effort expended by oncology patients and their family caregivers require more attention in future research and healthcare reform initiatives.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of pain and symptom management","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24704800","title":"Pain Medication Management Processes Used by Oncology Outpatients and Family Caregivers Part I: Health Systems Contexts.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Each year, nearly 20 million Americans with alcohol or illicit drug dependence do not receive treatment. The Affordable Care Act and parity laws are expected to result in increased access to treatment through integration of substance use disorder (SUD) services with primary care. However, relatively little research exists on the integration of SUD services into primary care settings. Our goal was to assess SUD service integration in California primary care settings and to identify the practice and policy facilitators and barriers encountered by providers who have attempted to integrate these services. METHODS: Primary survey and qualitative interview data were collected from the population of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in five California counties known to be engaged in SUD integration efforts was surveyed. From among the organizations that responded to the survey (78% response rate), four were purposively sampled based on their level of integration. Interviews were conducted with management, staff, and patients (n=18) from these organizations to collect further qualitative information on the barriers and facilitators of integration. RESULTS: Compared to mental health services, there was a trend for SUD services to be less integrated with primary care, and SUD services were rated significantly less effective. The perceived difference in effectiveness appeared to be due to provider training. Policy suggestions included expanding the SUD workforce that can bill Medicaid, allowing same-day billing of two services, facilitating easier reimbursement for medications, developing the workforce, and increasing community SUD specialty care capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to integrate SUD services with primary care face significant barriers, many of which arise at the policy level and are addressable.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Surveys","uri":{"id":"D006306","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services","uri":{"id":"D006296","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health Services","uri":{"id":"D008605","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Substance-Related Disorders","uri":{"id":"D019966","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Street Drugs","uri":{"id":"D013287","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","uri":{"id":"D058991","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parity","uri":{"id":"D010298","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"California","uri":{"id":"D002140","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suggestion","uri":{"id":"D013404","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24679108","title":"Integration of substance use disorder services with primary care: health center surveys and qualitative interviews.","year":"2014"}

Although currently 20 states mandate reimbursement for telehealth services and some private insurers have voluntarily covered those services in other states, relatively little is known about telehealth provider experiences with reimbursement from private insurance payers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate this, the American Telemedicine Association's (ATA's) Telemental Health Special Interest Group (SIG), the Policy Group, and the Business and Finance SIG, with the help of ATA staff, conducted a national private payer reimbursement online survey in 2012 using Survey Monkey™ (Palo Alto, CA) ( www.surveymonkey.com/ ). RESULTS: Survey responses were received from respondents in 46 of the 50 states. The survey found that telehealth services are being reimbursed by private payers but that progress in reimbursement has been relatively slow compared with earlier surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Key findings from this study were that government payers as well as several major private payers are highly influential in payment policies for telehealth private payers, that private payers have administrative rules regarding telehealth reimbursement that are barriers to services and reimbursement, and that some providers would benefit from being better informed about billing and coding for telehealth services and how to advocate for telehealth services reimbursement.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Public Opinion","uri":{"id":"D011639","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Haplorhini","uri":{"id":"D000882","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicare","uri":{"id":"D006278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leadership","uri":{"id":"D007857","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Specialization","uri":{"id":"D013038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Commerce","uri":{"id":"D003132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Telemedicine","uri":{"id":"D017216","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24654748","title":"Private payer telehealth reimbursement in the United States.","year":"2014"}

However, little is known about the practice of and factors associated with the provision of dietary counselling in primary health care in Germany. OBJECTIVES: To explore the attitudes towards and factors associated with the routine provision of dietary counselling in Germany using data from the nationwide, representative sample of the Physician Survey on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. METHODS: A total of 4074 randomly selected PCPs (response rate: 33.9%) provided data on dietary counselling for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on the 5 A's (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange), attitudes towards dietary counselling and patients' and practice characteristics. RESULTS: While the majority of PCPs (86%) reported having high levels of competence in providing dietary advice, only 49% felt they had been successful in counselling their patients on nutrition. PCPs routinely asked (68%) and advised patients to change their dietary habits more frequently (77%) compared to other counselling techniques based on the 5 A's. Female physicians and those with a higher percentage of privately insured patients and patients at higher risk of CVD were more likely to use the 5 A's to routinely counsel their patients on nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed high levels of involvement by German PCPs in CVD prevention and dietary counselling. The rather low perceived success of dietary intervention and differences with respect to patients' health insurance status indicate a need to address both communication skills in medical training and appropriate reimbursement of preventive services.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Family practice","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Status","uri":{"id":"D006304","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Status Indicators","uri":{"id":"D006305","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Prevention","uri":{"id":"D011322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiovascular Diseases","uri":{"id":"D002318","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Food Habits","uri":{"id":"D005510","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Health","uri":{"id":"D007348","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Coverage","uri":{"id":"D019458","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians, Primary Care","uri":{"id":"D058007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Attitude","uri":{"id":"D001290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Competency","uri":{"id":"D016743","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germany","uri":{"id":"D005858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24639564","title":"Dietary counselling for cardiovascular disease prevention in primary care settings: results from a German physician survey.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of implementing a pharmacogenomics service in a community pharmacy. SETTING A single community pharmacy that is part of a regional chain known for offering innovative pharmacy services. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Community pharmacists at the project site routinely provide clinical pharmacy services, including medication therapy management, immunizations, point-of-care testing, blood pressure monitoring, and diabetes education. PRACTICE INNOVATION The implementation of a pharmacogenomic testing and interpretation service for the liver isoenzyme cytochrome P450 2C19. PARTICIPANTS 18 patients taking clopidogrel, a drug metabolized by CYP2C19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rate of patient participation, rate of prescriber acceptance of pharmacist recommendation, time to perform genetic testing service, and number of claims submitted to and paid by insurance. RESULTS Of 41 patients taking clopidogrel and meeting project criteria, 18 (43.9%) enrolled and completed testing and interpretation of pharmacogenomic results. The mean time pharmacists spent completing all stages of the project with each participant was 76.6 minutes. The mean time to complete participation in the project (time between person's first and second visit) was 30.1 days. Nine patients had wild-type alleles, and pharmacists recommended continuation of therapy as ordered. Genetic variants were found in the other nine patients, and all pharmacist recommendations for modifications in therapy were ultimately accepted by prescribers. Overall, 17 patients consented to filing of reimbursement claims with their insurers. Five were not able to be billed due to submission difficulties. Of the remaining 12, none was paid. CONCLUSION A pharmacogenomics service can be an extension of medication therapy management services in a community pharmacy. Prescribers are receptive to having community pharmacists conduct pharmacogenomics testing, but reimbursement is a challenge.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Pharmacists

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"STUDY QUESTION: Do the socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics and motivations of oocyte donors differ in European countries? SUMMARY ANSWER: The socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics and motivations of oocyte donors differ considerably across countries. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There have been no other international studies comparing the characteristics of oocyte donors. Regarding their motivations, most studies indicate mixed motives. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The proposed study was a transversal epidemiological study. Data were collected from 63 voluntarily participating assisted reproduction technology centres practising oocyte donation in 11 European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, UK and Ukraine). The survey was conducted between September 2011 and June 2012 and ran for 1-6 calendar months depending on the number of cycles of oocyte donation performed at the centre. The sample size was computed in order to allow an estimate of the percentage of a relatively rare characteristic (∼2%) with a precision (95% confidence interval) of 1%. The calculation gave 1118 donors. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In total, 1423 forms were obtained from oocyte donors. All consecutive donors in these centres filled out an anonymous questionnaire when they started their hormonal stimulation, asking for their socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics, their motivations and compensation. Population characteristics were described and compared by country of donation. Motives for donation and mean amount of money were compared between countries and according to the donors characteristics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics and motivations of oocyte donors varied enormously across European countries. The number of received forms corresponded with a participation rate of 61.9% of the cycles performed by the participating centres. Mean age was 27.4 years. About 49% of donors were fully employed, 16% unemployed and 15% student. The motivation in the total group of donors was 47.8% pure altruism, 33.9% altruism and financial, 10.8% pure financial, 5.9% altruism and own treatment and finally 2% own treatment only. About 15% of the donors were egg sharers (patient donors), mainly from the UK and Poland. Women were donating for the first time in 55.4% of cases, for the second time in 20.3% and for the third time in 12.8%. The motivation to donate was significantly related to being of foreign origin (P < 0.01), age (P < 0.001), living in couple or not (P < 0.01), level of education (P < 0.001) and number of donations (P < 0.001). The amount of compensation differed considerably between centres and/or countries. The general donor profile in this study was a well-educated, 27-year-old woman living with her partner and child who mainly donated to help others. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The selection of clinics in some countries and the limited participation rate may have led to a bias in donor characteristics. A possible effect of social desirability in the answers by the donors should be taken into account. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The diversity of the donor population reflects the differences in European legislation (for example, on anonymity and payment) and economic circumstances. The differences in systems of reimbursement/payment demonstrate the need to have a thorough discussion on the specific meaning of these terms. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology. The authors declare no conflicting interests.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Human reproduction (Oxford,

Among these are tools that perform the following: (i) graphically display overall uncertainty within the IQWiG EF (scatter plots, confidence bands, and contour plots) and (ii) communicate the uncertainty around the reimbursable price. We found that, within the EF approach, most established plots were not always easy to interpret. Hence, we propose the use of price reimbursement acceptability curves-a modification of the well-known cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Furthermore, it emerges that the net monetary benefit allows an intuitive interpretation of parameter uncertainty within the EF approach. This research closes a gap for handling uncertainty in the economic evaluation approach of the IQWiG methods when using the EF. However, the precise consequences of uncertainty when determining prices are yet to be defined.

Diabetes self-management education has been shown to contribute to better disease control. However, it is not known which strategies involving educational programs are cost-effective. Telehealth applications might support chronic disease management. Transferability of successful distant patient self-management support programs to the Belgian setting needs to be confirmed by studies of a high methodological quality. \"The COACH Program\" was developed in Australia as target driven educational telephone delivered intervention to support people with different chronic conditions. It proved to be effective in patients with coronary heart disease after hospitalization. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of The COACH Program in people with type 2 diabetes in Belgium needs to be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were selected based on their medication consumption data and were recruited by their sickness fund. They were randomized to receive either usual care plus \"The COACH Program\" or usual care alone. The study will assess the difference in outcomes between groups. The primary outcome measure is the level of HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are: Total Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, body mass index, smoking status; proportion of people at target for HbA1c, LDL-Cholesterol and Blood Pressure; self-perceived health status, diabetes-specific emotional distress and satisfaction with diabetes care. The follow-up period is 18 months. Within-trial and modeled cost-utility analyses, to project effects over life-time horizon beyond the trial duration, will be undertaken from the perspective of the health care system if the intervention is effective. DISCUSSION: The study will enhance our understanding of the potential of telehealth in diabetes management in Belgium. Research on the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness is essential to support policy makers in future reimbursement and implementation decisions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC family practice","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Adult","Aged","Cost-Benefit Analysis","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Primary Health Care","Telenursing"]},"pmid":"24495633","title":"Nurse-led telecoaching of people with type 2 diabetes in primary care: rationale, design and baseline data of a randomized controlled trial.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The proportion of older patients with cancer is expected to grow exponentially in the next two decades. This population has large heterogeneity and it is well known that chronologic age is a poor predictor of outcomes. Research has shown that these patients are best served with a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) to formulate individualized treatment plans for better outcomes. However, the best model for CGA has yet to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our objective was to develop a highly functional model for the establishment of a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric oncology center in the setting of a university based NCI-designated cancer center. Each patient is evaluated by medical oncology, geriatric medicine, pharmacy, social work and nutrition. Expert navigation is provided to enhance the patient experience. At the conclusion, the inter-professional team meets to review each case and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. The patient is classified as Fit, Vulnerable, or Frail based on the complete CGA. RESULTS: The average age of patients seen was 80.7 with the most common diagnoses being breast, colorectal and lung cancers. Twenty four percent of patients were determined to be Fit, 47% Vulnerable, and 29% Frail. Twenty one percent of patients determined to be Frail by CGA received an ECOG score of 0-1 by the oncologist. Our pharmacists made specific recommendations in over 75% of patients and social work provided assistance in over 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to observe some interesting trends such as potential discordance with ECOG score and assessment of Fit/Vulnerable/Frail but due to limitations in the data, this paper is not able to illustrate definitive correlations. Several challenges with the development of the clinic include 1) patient related issues, 2) navigation, 3) financial reimbursement, 4) referral patterns, and 5) coordination of care during office hours. We feel that we have been able to establish a model for a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric oncology evaluation center in the setting of a university based cancer center.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of geriatric oncology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Medicine","uri":{"id":"D012936","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"State Medicine","uri":{"id":"D013222","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D008175","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medical Oncology","uri":{"id":"D008495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Work","uri":{"id":"D012947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Geriatric Assessment","uri":{"id":"D015577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lung","uri":{"id":"D008168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacists","uri":{"id":"D010595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Geriatrics","uri":{"id":"D005853","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacies","uri":{"id":"D010594","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmacy","uri":{"id":"D010604","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24495585","title":"Development of a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric oncology center, the Thomas Jefferson University Experience.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree to which reimbursement prices in Australia and England differ for a range of generic drugs, and to analyse the supply- and demand-side factors that may contribute to these differences. METHODS: Australian and English reimbursement prices were compared for a range of generic drugs using pricing information obtained from government websites. Next, a literature review was conducted to identify supply- and demand-side factors that could affect generic prices in Australia and England. Various search topics were identified addressing potential supply-side (e.g. market approval, intellectual property protection of patented drugs, generic pricing policy, market size, generic supply chain and discounting practices) and demand-side (consumers, prescribers and pharmacists) factors. Related terms were searched in academic databases, official government websites, national statistical databases and internet search engines. RESULTS: Analysis of drug reimbursement prices for 15 generic molecules (representing 45 different drug presentations) demonstrated that Australian prices were on average over 7-fold higher than in England. Significant supply-side differences included aspects of pricing policy, the relative size of the generics markets and the use of clawback policies. Major differences in demand-side policies related to generic prescribing, pharmacist substitution and consumer incentives. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent reforms, the Australian Government continues to pay higher prices than its English counterpart for many generic medications. The results suggest that particular policy areas may benefit from review in Australia, including the length of the price-setting process, the frequency of subsequent price adjustments, the extent of price competition between originators and generics, medical professionals' knowledge about generic medicines and incentives for generic prescribing. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC? Prices of generic drugs have been the subject of much scrutiny over recent years. From 2005 to 2010 the Australian Government responded to observations that Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prices for many generics were higher than in numerous comparable countries by instituting several reforms aimed at reducing the prices of generics. Despite this, several studies have demonstrated that prices for generic statins (one class of cholesterol-lowering drug) are higher in Australia compared with England and many other developed countries, and prices of numerous other generics remain higher than in the USA and New Zealand. Recently there has been increasing interest in why these differences exist. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD? By including a much larger range of commonly used and costly generic drugs, this paper builds significantly on the limited previous investigations of generic drug prices in Australia and England. Additionally, this is the first comprehensive investigation of multiple supply- and, in particular, demand-side factors that may explain any price differences between these countries. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS? Practitioners may contribute to the higher prices of generic medications in Australia compared with England through relatively low rates of generic prescribing. There are also significant implications for health policy makers, as this paper demonstrates that if Australia achieved the same prices as England for many generic drugs there could be substantial savings for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital

But little is known about how these early programs achieved success. We studied six CRPs to identify the major challenges in and lessons learned from implementing these initiatives. The CRP participants we interviewed identified several factors that contributed to their programs' success, including the presence of a strong institutional champion, investing in building and marketing the program to skeptical clinicians, and making it clear that the results of such transformative change will take time. Many of the early CRP adopters we interviewed expressed support for broader experimentation with these programs even in settings that differ from their own, such as systems that do not own and control their liability insurer, and in states without strong tort reforms.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health affairs (Project Hope)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Safety","uri":{"id":"D061214","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Liability","uri":{"id":"D007351","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compensation and Redress","uri":{"id":"D035881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Michigan","uri":{"id":"D008824","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Liability, Legal","uri":{"id":"D016365","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disclosure","uri":{"id":"D030881","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24395931","title":"Communication-and-resolution programs: the challenges and lessons learned from six early adopters.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of tobacco control policy for different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We aimed to evaluate SES-specific cost-effectiveness ratios of policies with known favorable effect in low-SES groups: a tobacco tax increase and reimbursement of cessation support. METHODS: A computer model of the adult population specified by smoking behavior (never/current/former smoker), age, gender, and SES simulated policy scenarios reflecting the implementation of a €0.22 tobacco tax increase or full reimbursement of cessation support, which were compared. Relating differences in costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained generated cost-effectiveness ratios for each SES group. RESULTS: In a cohort of 11 million people, the tobacco tax increase resulted in 27,000 additional quitters after 5 years, who were proportionally divided among the SES groups. Reimbursement led to 59,000 additional quitters, with relatively more quitters in higher-SES groups. The number of QALYs gained were 3,400-6,200 among the various SES groups for the tax increase and 6,300-14,000 for the reimbursement scenario. For both interventions, favorability of the cost-effectiveness ratios increased with SES: costs per QALY decreased from €6,100 to €4,500 for the tax increase and from €21,000 to €11,000 for reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: The reimbursement policy produced the greatest overall health gain. Surprisingly, neither tax increase nor reimbursement reduced health disparities. Differences in use were too small to compensate for improved health gains per quitter among higher-SES groups. Both policies qualified as cost-effective overall, with more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for high-SES than for low-SES groups.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Status","uri":{"id":"D006304","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Simulation","uri":{"id":"D003198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Class","uri":{"id":"D012923","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality-Adjusted Life Years","uri":{"id":"D019057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compensation and Redress","uri":{"id":"D035881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Taxes","uri":{"id":"D013660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality-Adjusted Life Years","uri":{"id":"D019057","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24388862","title":"Tobacco control policies specified according to socioeconomic status: health disparities and cost-effectiveness.","year":"2014"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a non-randomized retrospective study, we selected 90 patients who underwent (01/2010-12/2011) partial and radical nephrectomy for clinical renal masses ≤7 cm (cT1N0M0) and divided them into laparoscopic [laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN), laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN)], LESS [laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy (LESS-PN), laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy (LESS-RN)] and open groups [open partial nephrectomy (OPN), open radical nephrectomy (ORN)]. Patients were matched for age, sex, body mass index, ASA score and tumour side. Primary endpoints were evaluation of intraoperative costs (general, laparoscopic, sutures, haemostatic agents, anaesthesia, and surgeon/nurses fee), total insurance and estimated daily reimbursement. RESULTS: MIS showed longer operative time (p ≤ .02) and shorter hospital stay (p ≤ .04). Total costs were higher (p ≤ .03) in MIS (LRN: 4,091.5 <euro>; LPN: 4,390.4 <euro>; LESS-RN: 3,866 <euro>; and LESS-PN: 3,450 <euro>) if compared with open (OPN: 2,216.8.8 <euro>, ORN: 1,606.4 <euro>). Laparoscopic materials incised mainly in total costs of MIS (38-58.1 %). Reusable instruments reduced LESS laparoscopic costs (LESS-PN: 1,312.2 <euro> vs. LRN: 2,212.2 <euro>, p < .0001). Intraoperative frozen section and DJ ureteric stenting (general costs) (p ≤ .008) and haemostatic agents use (p ≤ .01) were higher in nephron sparing surgery (NSS), due to more frequent use of ancillary procedures necessary for a safe management of such an approach. Estimated anaesthesia costs and doctor/nurses fee were higher in MIS (p ≤ .02). Whereas total final reimbursements were comparable (p ≥ .8), estimated daily reimbursements were lower in MIS (p < .001) due to higher intraoperative costs and longer operative time. CONCLUSION: Well-known advantages offered by MIS/NSS face higher total intraoperative costs and 'paradoxical' reduced healthcare reimbursement. We believe that local health systems should consider a subclassification with different compensations, which will incentive NSS and MIS approaches.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"World journal

Four focus groups, two for older people with diabetes and two for health professionals, were conducted. All participants were purposively sampled from two communities in Shanghai, China. Six barriers were identified: overdependence on but dislike of western medicine, family role expectations, cuisine culture, lack of trustworthy information sources, deficits in communication between clients and health professionals, and restriction of reimbursement regulations. Facilitators included family and peer support, good relationships with health professionals, simple and practical instruction and a favourable community environment.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The current economic environment necessitates efforts to prevent avoidable losses in clinical revenue in academic cardiothoracic surgery programs. Inadequate documentation frequently results in delayed, denied, or reduced reimbursement. With the recent increase in integrated residency programs, documentation and compliance are becoming increasingly dependent on junior residents; however, their understanding of reimbursement and documentation guidelines is currently unknown. METHODS: An electronically distributed, multi-institutional survey of 6 general and subspecialty surgery programs was conducted consisting of open-ended numeric estimation of Medicare reimbursement for various levels of patient encounters. Closed-ended questions were used to assess resident knowledge of documentation requirements, accompanied by self-estimated compliance with those requirements. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent (n = 106) of residents completed the survey. Most residents (77%) believe they play the primary role in documentation; however, knowledge of and compliance with higher level documentation practices range from 19% to 78% and 41% to 76%, respectively. On average, residents overestimate Medicare reimbursement of lower level encounters by as much as 77% and underestimate higher level encounters by as much as 38%. In many cases, the standard deviation of residents' estimates approaches the actual reimbursement value. CONCLUSIONS: Residents have a limited knowledge of documentation requirements. Self-reported compliance, even when guidelines are known, is low. Estimation of financial reimbursement is extremely variable. Residents overestimate reimbursement of lower level encounters and underappreciate reimbursement at higher levels. Ensuring appropriate reimbursement for services rendered will require formal cardiothoracic resident education and ongoing quality control.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Annals of thoracic surgery","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Documentation","Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice","Internship and Residency","Questionnaires","Reimbursement Mechanisms","Specialties, Surgical","United States"]},"pmid":"24315406","title":"Resident awareness of documentation requirements and reimbursement: a multi-institutional survey.","year":"2014"}

OBJECTIVE: To assess U.S. physicians’ impressions about the direction of U.S. health care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), whether that legislation will make reimbursement more or less fair, and examine how those judgments relate to political affiliation and perceived social responsibility. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, mailed, self-reported survey. PARTICIPANTS: Simple random sample of 3,897 U.S.physicians. MAIN MEASURES: Views on the ACA in general, reimbursement under the ACA in particular, and perceived social responsibility. KEY RESULTS: Among 2,556 physicians who responded (RR2: 65 %), approximately two out of five (41 %) believed that the ACA will turn U.S. health care in the right direction and make physician reimbursement less fair (44 %). Seventy-two percent of physicians endorsed a general professional obligation to address societal health policy issues, 65 % agreed that every physician is professionally obligated to care for the uninsured or underinsured, and half (55 %) were willing to accept limits on coverage for expensive drugs and procedures for the sake of expanding access to basic health care. In multivariable analyses, liberals and independents were both substantially more likely to endorse the ACA (OR 33.0 [95 % CI, 23.6–46.2]; OR 5.0 [95 % CI, 3.7–6.8], respectively), as were physicians reporting a salary (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.2–2.5])or salary plus bonus (OR 1.4 [95 % CI, 1.1–1.9)compensation type. In the same multivariate models, those who agreed that addressing societal health policy issues are within the scope of their professional obligations (OR 1.5 [95 % CI, 1.0–2.0]), who believe physicians are professionally obligated to care for the uninsured / under-insured (OR 1.7 [95 % CI,1.3–2.4]), and who agreed with limiting coverage for expensive drugs and procedures to expand insurance coverage (OR 2.3 [95 % CI, 1.8–3.0]), were all significantly more likely to endorse the ACA. Surgeons and procedural specialists were less likely to endorse it (OR 0.5 [95 % CI, 0.4–0.7], OR 0.6 [95 %CI, 0.5–0.9], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Significant subsets of U.S. physicians express concerns about the direction of U.S. health care under recent health care reform legislation.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"STUDY QUESTION: What is the impact of the Belgian legislation (1 July 2003), coupling reimbursement of six assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles per patient to restricted embryo transfer policy, on cumulative delivery rate (CDR) per patient? SUMMARY ANSWER: The introduction of Belgian legislation in ART had no negative impact on the CDR per patient based on realistic estimates within six cycles or 36 months. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The introduction of Belgian legislation limiting the number of embryos for transfer resulted in a reduction of the multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) per cycle by 50%. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study with a study group after implementation of the new ART legislation (July 2003 to June 2006) and the control group, before legislation (July 1999 to June 2002). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: CDR was compared in an academic tertiary setting between a study group after legislation (n = 795 patients, 1927 fresh and 383 frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles) and a control group before legislation (n = 463 patients, 876 fresh and 185 FET cycles) within six cycles or 36 months, delivery or discontinuation of treatment. The CDR was estimated using life table analysis considering pessimistic, optimistic and realistic scenarios and compared after adjustment for confounding variables. In the realistic scenario we included information on embryo quality to define the prognosis of each patient discontinuing treatment. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In the realistic scenario, CDR within 36 months was comparable (all ages, P = 0.221) in study group (60.8%) and control group (65.6%), as well as in different age groups (<36 years, P = 0.242; 36-39 years, P = 0.851; 40-42 years, P = 0.840). In the realistic scenario applied to six cycles, we found lower CDRs in the study group than in the control group within the two first cycles (all ages, P = 0.009; <36 years, P = 0.007) but no difference in CDRs between the two groups within the four subsequent cycles (all ages P = 0.232; <36 years, P = 0.198). The CDR within six cycles was 60 and 65.3% for study group and control group, respectively, for all ages, and 65.8 and 70.4%, respectively, in the subgroup younger than 36 years. In women ≥36 years, CDR within six cycles was comparable in both groups (36-39 years, 43% in study versus 44.4% in control group, P = 0.730; 40-42 years, 21% in study versus 23% in control group, P = 0.786). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A retrospective cohort study design was the only way to study the impact of legislation on CDR. Owing to the retrospective nature of this analysis over a long period of time, our data are potentially influenced by improvements in techniques and therefore improved success rates in ART over time. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This 'Belgian model' can now be considered for application worldwide in countries with the aim to reduce the main ART side effect (high MPR) and its associated costs without a negative effect on the main intended effect (high CDR).

AIM: To determine the clinical and economic burden of SSI over a two-year period and to predict the financial consequences of their elimination. METHODS: SSI surveillance and Patient Level Information and Costing System (PLICS) datasets for patients who underwent major surgical procedures at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust between April 2010 and March 2012 were consolidated. The main outcome measures were the attributable postoperative length of stay (LOS), cost, and impact on the margin differential (profitability) of SSI. A secondary outcome was the predicted financial consequence of eliminating all SSIs. FINDINGS: The median additional LOS attributable to SSI was 10 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 7-13 days] and a total of 4694 bed-days were lost over the two-year period. The median additional cost attributable to SSI was £5,239 (95% CI: 4,622-6,719) and the aggregate extra cost over the study period was £2,491,424. After calculating the opportunity cost of eliminating all SSIs that had occurred in the two-year period, the combined overall predicted financial benefit of doing so would have been only £694,007. For seven surgical categories, the hospital would have been financially worse off if it had successfully eliminated all SSIs. CONCLUSION: SSI causes significant clinical and economic burden. Nevertheless the current system of reimbursement provided a financial disincentive to their reduction.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of hospital infection","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Length of Stay","uri":{"id":"D007902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Trust","uri":{"id":"D035502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"England","uri":{"id":"D004739","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Length of Stay","uri":{"id":"D007902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Costs and Cost Analysis","uri":{"id":"D003365","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross Infection","uri":{"id":"D003428","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Surgical Wound Infection","uri":{"id":"D013530","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infection Control","uri":{"id":"D017053","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Costs and Cost Analysis","Cross Infection","England","Hospitals","Humans","Infection Control","Length of Stay","Prevalence","Surgical Wound Infection"]},"pmid":"24268456","title":"Clinical and economic burden of surgical site infection (SSI) and predicted financial consequences of elimination of SSI from an English hospital.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that copy-pasted components of electronic notes may not reliably reflect the care delivered. Federal agencies have raised concerns that such components may be used to justify inappropriately inflated claims for reimbursement. It is not known whether copied information is used to justify higher evaluation and management (E&M) charges. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the relationship between the level of evaluation and management (E&M) charges and the method of documentation (none, distinct or copied) of lifestyle counseling (diet, exercise and weight loss) for patients with diabetes mellitus. To determine the association, an ordered multinomial logistic regression model that corrected for clustering within individual providers and patients and adjusted for patient and encounter characteristics was utilized. E&M charge level served as the primary outcome variable. Patients were included if they were followed by primary care physicians affiliated with two academic hospitals for a minimum of two years between 01/01/2000 and 12/13/2009. RESULTS: Lifestyle counseling was documented in 65.4% of 155,168 primary care encounters of 16,164 patients. Copied counseling was identified in 12,527 encounters. In multivariable analysis higher E&M charges were associated with older patient age, longer notes, treatment with insulin, medication changes and acute complaints. However, copied lifestyle counseling was associated with a decrease of 70.5% in the odds of higher E&M charge levels when time spent on counseling (required to justify higher charges based on counseling) was recorded (p<0.0001). This finding is opposite to what would have been expected if the impetus for copied documentation of lifestyle counseling was an increase in submitted E&M charges. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that copied documentation of lifestyle counseling is used to justify higher evaluation and management charges. Higher charges were generally associated with indicators of complexity of care.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC health services

Little is known about how clinic-level patient characteristics affect quality, particularly in community health centers (CHCs). METHODS: Using data from electronic health records for 4019 diabetic patients from 23 primary care CHCs in the OCHIN practice-based research network, we calculated correlations between a clinic's patient panel characteristics and rates of delivery of diabetes preventive services in 2007. Using regression models, we estimated the proportion of variability in clinics' preventive services rates associated with the variability in the clinics' patient panel characteristics. We also explored whether clinics' performance rates were affected by how patient panel denominators were defined. RESULTS: Clinic rates of hemoglobin testing, influenza immunizations, and lipid screening were positively associated with the percentage of patients with continuous health insurance coverage and negatively associated with the percentage of uninsured patients. Microalbumin screening rates were positively associated with the percentage of racial minorities in a clinic's panel. Associations remained consistent with different panel denominators. CONCLUSIONS: Clinic variability in delivery rates of preventive services correlates with differences in clinics' patient panel characteristics, particularly the percentage of patients with continuous insurance coverage. Quality scores that do not account for these differences could create disincentives to clinics providing diabetes care for vulnerable patients.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Community Health Centers","Diabetes Mellitus","Electronic Health Records","Female","Humans","Male","Mass Screening","Middle Aged","Preventive Health Services","Primary Health Care","Quality of Health Care","Retrospective Studies","United States"]},"pmid":"24204063","title":"Diabetes care quality is highly correlated with patient panel characteristics.","year":"2013 Nov-Dec"}

BACKGROUND: Neonatal arterial switch operation is the standard of care for d-TGA. Little is known about the effects of age at operation on clinical outcomes or costs for these neonates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants at ≥36 weeks' gestation, with d-TGA, with or without ventricular septal defects, admitted to our institution at 5 days of age or younger, between January 1, 2003 and October 1, 2012. Children with other cardiac abnormalities or other major comorbid conditions were excluded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the effects of age at operation on major morbidity and hospital reimbursement. RESULTS: A total of 140 infants met inclusion criteria. Reimbursement data were available for them through January 1, 2012 (n = 128). The mortality rate was 1.4% (n = 2). Twenty percent (n = 28) experienced a major morbidity. The median costs were $60,000, in 2012 dollars (range: $25,000 to $549,000). The median age at operation was 5 days (range: 1 to 12 days). For every day later that surgery was performed, beyond day of life 3, the odds of major morbidity increased by 47% (range: 23% to 66%, p < 0.001) and costs increased by 8% (range: 5% to 11%, p < 0.001), after considering the effects of sex, birth weight, gestational age, year at which surgery was performed, transfer, weekend admission, insurance, surgeon, septostomy, bypass and cross-clamp times, and the presence of ventricular septal defects or abnormal coronary anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: Delay of neonatal arterial switch operation beyond 3 days is significantly associated with increased morbidity and healthcare costs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about Medicaid policies regarding reimbursement for placement of sealants on primary molars. The authors identified Medicaid programs that reimbursed dentists for placing primary molar sealants and hypothesized that these programs had higher reimbursement rates than did state programs that did not reimburse for primary molar sealants. METHODS: The authors obtained Medicaid reimbursement data from online fee schedules and determined whether each state Medicaid program reimbursed for primary molar sealants (no or yes). The outcome measure was the reimbursement rate for permanent tooth sealants (calculated in 2012 U.S. dollars). The authors compared mean reimbursement rates by using the t test (α = .05). RESULTS: Seventeen Medicaid programs reimbursed dentists for placing primary molar sealants (34 percent), and the mean reimbursement rate was $27.57 (range, $16.00 [Maine] to $49.68 [Alaska]). All 50 programs reimbursed dentists for placement of sealants on permanent teeth. The mean reimbursement for permanent tooth sealants was significantly higher in programs that reimbursed for primary molar sealants than in programs that did not ($28.51 and $23.67, respectively; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most state Medicaid programs do not reimburse dentists for placing sealants on primary molars, but programs that do so have significantly higher reimbursement rates. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Medicaid reimbursement rates are related to dentists' participation in Medicaid and children's dental care use. Reimbursement for placement of sealants on primary molars is a proxy for Medicaid program generosity.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dental Care","uri":{"id":"D003729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fee Schedules","uri":{"id":"D005245","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pit and Fissure Sealants","uri":{"id":"D010895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Appointments and Schedules","uri":{"id":"D001071","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dentists","uri":{"id":"D003815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicaid","uri":{"id":"D008484","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molar","uri":{"id":"D008963","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proxy","uri":{"id":"D019727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alaska","uri":{"id":"D000413","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fee Schedules","uri":{"id":"D005245","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maine","uri":{"id":"D008281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tooth","uri":{"id":"D014070","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tooth Eruption","uri":{"id":"D014078","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24177406","title":"Reimbursement rates and policies for primary molar pit-and-fissure sealants across state Medicaid programs.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: With the focus of modern health care on preventive care, and the well-known benefits of smoking cessation on improving health and reducing healthcare costs, smoking cessation is a key focus of healthcare reform. To change the smoking habits of the U.S. population, two strategies are of particular importance to healthcare professionals: promoting tobacco-free environments in healthcare systems and expanding affordable and effective treatments. DATA SOURCES: Recent policy literature. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to providing smoking cessation counseling most frequently cited by healthcare professionals are lack of training and poor reimbursement; however, recent legislation, for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), should make preventive services more available and affordable. Nurse practitioners (NPs) have vast experience in addressing health promotion and disease prevention, and are therefore well placed to lead this reform. However, despite consistently higher referrals of tobacco-dependent patients for smoking cessation interventions than any other group of healthcare provider, evidence suggests that NPs are not adequately trained to treat this addiction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article is a call to action for NPs to become familiar with the tobacco cessation policy changes affecting clinical practice, to become experts in tobacco treatment, and to take the lead in this healthcare reform initiative.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Personnel","uri":{"id":"D006282","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Smoking Cessation","uri":{"id":"D016540","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Promotion","uri":{"id":"D006293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurse Practitioners","uri":{"id":"D009722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Reform","uri":{"id":"D018166","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Cessation","uri":{"id":"D020340","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","uri":{"id":"D058991","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24170619","title":"Nurse practitioners, wake up and smell the smoke.","year":"2013"}

New technologies have the potential to increase the use of genetic information in clinical decision-making, furthering prevention, surveillance, and safer, more effective drug therapies for cancer patients. Personalized medicine can have different meanings to different people. The context for personalized medicine in the present paper is genetic testing, which offers the promise of refining treatment decisions for those diagnosed with chronic and life-threatening illnesses. Personalized medicine and genetic characterization of tumours can also give direction to the development of novel drugs. Genetic testing will increasingly become an essential part of clinical decision-making. In Canada, provinces are responsible for health care, and most have unique policies and programs in place to address cancer control. The result is inconsistency in access to and delivery of therapies and other interventions, beyond the differences expected because of demographic factors and clinical education. Inconsistencies arising from differences in resources, policy, and application of evidence-informed personalized cancer medicine exacerbate patient access to appropriate testing and quality care. Geographic variations in cancer incidence and mortality rates in Canada-with the Atlantic provinces and Quebec having higher rates, and British Columbia having the lowest rates-are well documented. Our purpose here is to provide an understanding of current and future applications of personalized medicine in oncology, to highlight the benefits of personalized medicine for patients, and to describe issues and opportunities for improvement in the coordination of personalized medicine in Canada. Efficient and more rapid adoption of personalized medicine in oncology in Canada could help overcome those issues and improve cancer prevention and care. That task might benefit from the creation of a National Genetics Advisory Panel that would review research and provide recommendations on tests for funding or reimbursement, guidelines, service delivery models, laboratory quality assurance, education, and communication. More has to be known about the current state of personalized cancer medicine in Canada, and strategies have to be developed to inform and improve understanding and appropriate coordination and delivery. Our hope is that the perspectives emphasized in this paper will stimulate discussion and further research to create a more informed response.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Individualized Medicine","uri":{"id":"D057285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Testing","uri":{"id":"D005820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"British Columbia","uri":{"id":"D001955","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Individualized Medicine","uri":{"id":"D057285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adoption","uri":{"id":"D000300","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Canada","uri":{"id":"D002170","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Laboratories","uri":{"id":"D007753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hope","uri":{"id":"D065026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quebec","uri":{"id":"D011792","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24155644","title":"Benefits, issues, and recommendations for personalized medicine in oncology in Canada.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The outcomes of ACL reconstructions in terms of patient satisfaction and function are well known. Most orthopaedic surgeons feel that Medicare and other payors do not reimburse enough for this surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine how much patients are willing to pay for this surgery and compare it to reimbursement rates. METHODS: We constructed a survey which described the function and limitations of an ACL deficient knee and the expected function of that knee after an ACL reconstruction. We then asked the volunteers how much they would be willing to pay for an ACL reconstruction if it were their knee. We also gathered data on the yearly earnings and Tegner activity level of the volunteers. In all, 143 volunteers completed the survey. We computed correlation coefficients between willingness to pay and both yearly earnings and Tegner activity level. RESULTS: The average amount that the volunteers were willing to pay for an ACL reconstruction was $4,867.00. There was no correlation between yearly earnings and willingness to pay. The correlation coefficient was 0.34. There was a weak correlation between Tegner activity level and willingness to pay. This correlation coefficient was 0.81. The Medicare allowable rate for ACL reconstruction (CPT 29888) in the geographic area of the study was $1,132.00. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrates that patients are willing to pay much more than traditional payors for ACL reconstruction. These payors undervalue the benefit of this surgery to the patient. There is increasing pressure on orthopaedic surgeons to not participate in insurance plans that reimburse poorly. This places an increasing financial burden on the patient. This study suggests that patients may be willing to pay more for their surgery than their insurance plan and accept more of this burden.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Bulletin of the Hospital

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Health economics has been an established feature of the research, policymaking, practice and management in the delivery of healthcare. However its role is increasing as the cost of healthcare begins to drive changes in most healthcare systems. Thus the output from cost effectiveness studies is now being taken into account when making reimbursement decisions, e.g. in Australia and the United Kingdom. Against this background it is also recognised that the health economic tools employed in healthcare, and particularly the output from the use of these tools however, are not always employed in the routine delivery of services. One of the notable consequences of this situation is the poor record of innovation in healthcare with respect to the adoption of new technologies, and the realisation of their benefits. The evidence base for the effectiveness of diagnostic services is well known to be limited, and one consequence of this has been a very limited literature on cost effectiveness. One reason for this situation is undoubtedly the reimbursement strategies employed in laboratory medicine for many years, simplistically based on the complexity of the test procedure, and the delivery as a cost-per-test service. This has proved a disincentive to generate the required evidence, and little effort to generate an integrated investment and disinvestment business case, associated with care pathway changes. Point-of-care testing creates a particularly challenging scenario because, on the one hand, the unit cost-per-test is larger through the loss of the economy of scale offered by automation, whilst it offers the potential of substantial savings through enabling rapid delivery of results, and reduction of facility costs.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Early prenatal diagnosis of fetal sex is necessary to optimize pregnancy management in families known to be at risk of some heritable disorders. The demonstration of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in the mother's blood has made it possible to identify Y chromosome sequences in maternal blood and to determine fetal sex noninvasively, during the first trimester. This procedure can significantly reduce the number of invasive procedures for women with fetuses at risk of sex-linked diseases and optimize the management of these pregnancies. Fetal sex can be diagnosed by ultrasound with the same sensitivity and specificity, but later in pregnancy. We performed a review of the published literature evaluating the use of cffDNA and ultrasound for prenatal determination of fetal sex during the first trimester of pregnancy. We present the feasibility of the two methods and their impact on clinical practice. We applied a sensitive search of multiple bibliographic databases including Pubmed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Web of science between 1998 and 2013. Sixteen reports of the determination of fetal sex in maternal blood and 13 reports of the determination by ultrasound met our inclusion criteria. We found a sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100% from 8 weeks of gestation for cffDNA and from 13 weeks of gestation for ultrasound respectively. Based on this review, we conclude that fetal sex can be determined with a high level of accuracy by analyzing cffDNA and at an earlier gestation than ultrasound. Ten years after the first feasibility study, the French National Authority for Health (HAS) released a technological assessment report on the determination of fetal sex in maternal blood, which has resulted in validating this test for reimbursement by the national health insurance fund for the following indications: X-linked recessive disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: The rate of thoracic biopsies overall and by type of biopsy from 1998 to 2010 is not known. The aim of this study was to examine the utilization rate of various types of thoracic biopsies within the Medicare population. METHODS: Source data was obtained from the CMS Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 1998 to 2010. Allowed primary claims submitted for percutaneous thoracic biopsy, bronchoscopic thoracic biopsy, and surgical thoracic biopsy were extracted. Annual volume and utilization rates were calculated and analyzed by biopsy type and provider type. RESULTS: Total thoracic biopsy volume in 1998 was 176,125 and in 2010 was 167,911 (-4.7%). The utilization rate for all thoracic biopsies decreased from 5.47 per 1,000 in 1998 to 4.76 per 1,000 (-13.0%) in 2010. The percutaneous biopsy utilization rate increased 3.6% from 1998 to 2010, while the rate for surgical biopsy decreased by 20.9% and the rate of bronchoscopic biopsy decreased by 19.6% during the same time period. In 2010, radiologists performed 96.4% (58,679) of all percutaneous biopsies. Radiologists' thoracic biopsy market share increased from 26.2% (46,084 of 176,125) in 1998 to 35.0% (58,700 of 167,911) in 2010 (+33.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of thoracic biopsy decreased from 1998 to 2010, with fewer biopsies being performed surgically and bronchoscopically and more biopsies being performed percutaneously. Radiologists are responsible for an increasing role in thoracic diagnosis, as they have increased market share of thoracic biopsies. These findings may be the result of changing trends toward less invasive procedures, changing patterns of reimbursement, and increased availability of percutaneous biopsy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biopsy","uri":{"id":"D001706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicare","uri":{"id":"D006278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thorax","uri":{"id":"D013909","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Filing","uri":{"id":"D005371","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bronchoscopes","uri":{"id":"D020680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicare","uri":{"id":"D006278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiology","uri":{"id":"D011871","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thoracic Diseases","uri":{"id":"D013896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiography, Thoracic","uri":{"id":"D013902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Utilization Review","uri":{"id":"D014600","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Image-Guided Biopsy","uri":{"id":"D061705","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Humans","Image-Guided Biopsy","Medicare","Prevalence","Radiography, Thoracic","Radiology","Thoracic Diseases","United States","Utilization Review"]},"pmid":"24091047","title":"The increasing role of radiologists in thoracic diagnosis: more thoracic biopsies are performed percutaneously.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"CONTEXT: Little is known about the incorporation of integrative medicine (IM) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into family medicine residency programs. OBJECTIVE: The Society for Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM) approved a set of CAM/IM competencies for family medicine residencies. We hope to evaluate whether residency programs are implementing such competencies into their curriculum using an online survey tool. We also hope to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Residency Directors (RDs) on the CAM/IM competencies. DESIGN: A survey was distributed by the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM) Educational Research Alliance to RDs via e-mail. The survey was distributed to 431 RDs. Of those who received it, 212 responded, giving a response rate of 49.1%. Questions assessed the knowledge and attitudes of CAM/IM competencies and incorporation of CAM/IM into the residency curriculum. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of RDs were aware of the competencies. In terms of RD attitudes, 58% reported that CAM/IM is an important component of residents' curriculum; yet, 60% report not having specific learning objectives for CAM/IM in their residency curriculum. Among all programs, barriers to CAM/IM implementation included time in residents' schedules (77%); faculty training (75%); access to CAM experts (43%); lack of reimbursement (43%); and financial resources (29%). CONCLUSIONS: While many RDs are aware of the STFM CAM/IM competencies and acknowledge their role in residence education, there are many barriers that prevent residencies from implementing the STFM

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Although many studies have examined medication adherence in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), no prospective trial has compared medication adherence between patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or with optimal medical therapy (OMT) in real life. This study sought to compare the adherence to evidence-based secondary preventive medications in patients with documented CAD treated with PCI and OMT, or OMT alone. METHODS: We evaluated adherence to statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) during a 6-month follow-up in 232 patients with documented CAD, comparing patients treated with PCI and those receiving medical therapy alone. Medication adherence was measured with reference to national reimbursement database records. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 232 patients who survived the 6-month follow-up, the percentages of adherent patients according to prescription records (prespecified primary endpoint) were 53·6% (n = 82) in the PCI group and 33·8% (n = 27) in the OMT group (P = 0·004). Analysis of the individual medication classes revealed similar results for beta-blockers (86·0% in PCI group vs. 72·5% in OMT group, P = 0·006) and statins (64·5% in PCI group vs. 44·0% in OMT group, P = 0·003). Adherence to ACEI was also higher in the PCI group, but the difference was not statistically significant (77·6% vs. 69·3%, P = 0·17). By logistic regression analysis, belonging to the PCI group was an independent predictor of medication adherence [B = 2·20 (1·06-4·50), P = 0·03)]. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In the present study we demonstrated that adherence to evidence-based medication therapies in patients treated with PCI is significantly higher than in patients treated with OMT alone. Medication adherence should be followed carefully in CAD patients treated with OMT.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacy and

The changes in the structure of reimbursement policies necessary to incorporate economic evaluation have been accomplished without major difficulty in most jurisdictions. However, several methodological differences in international guidelines for economic evaluation exist, only some of which can easily be justified. A number of beneficial changes in reimbursement processes have also been observed, such as a trend toward requiring the measurement of more meaningful clinical end points and increased engagement between manufacturers, drug regulators, and payers. A consistent finding in studies of reimbursement decisions is that economic considerations have been influential, second only to the strength of the clinical evidence for the drug of interest. The impact of economic evaluation on the allocation of health care resources is hard to ascertain because little is known about the extent to which reimbursement decisions actually lead to changes in health care practice. However, there is evidence that economic evaluation has assisted price negotiations and enabled reimbursement agencies to target drugs to those patients who will benefit the most.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of health politics, policy and law","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Evaluation","uri":{"id":"D004341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Resources","uri":{"id":"D006295","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Delivery Systems","uri":{"id":"D016503","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug and Narcotic Control","uri":{"id":"D004335","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hardness","uri":{"id":"D006244","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leadership","uri":{"id":"D007857","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Negotiating","uri":{"id":"D017008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cost-Benefit Analysis","uri":{"id":"D003362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Decision Making","uri":{"id":"D003657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"State Medicine","uri":{"id":"D013222","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Costs and Cost Analysis","uri":{"id":"D003365","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Health, Reimbursement","uri":{"id":"D007349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance, Pharmaceutical Services","uri":{"id":"D007356","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Politics","uri":{"id":"D011057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Rationing","uri":{"id":"D015276","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Economic","uri":{"id":"D018803","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prescription Drugs","uri":{"id":"D055553","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Cost-Benefit Analysis","Costs and Cost Analysis","Decision Making","Health Care Rationing","Humans","Insurance, Health, Reimbursement","Insurance, Pharmaceutical Services","Models, Economic","Politics","Prescription Drugs","State Medicine"]},"pmid":"23974475","title":"Twenty years of using economic evaluations for drug reimbursement decisions: what has been achieved?","year":"2013"}

STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The modality of choice for detection of prostate cancer is multiparametric MRI. Furthermore, PET/CT is used, in particular, for the detection and staging of distant metastases and recurrent disease. For assessment of bone metastases, the method most commonly used is bone scintigraphy. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: The development of a simultaneous hybrid PET/MRI system is the last great \"fusion\" of the known cross-sectional image modalities. In addition, synthesis of new, innovative tracers such as (18)F-FACBC or (68)Ga-PSMA allows more specific detection of prostate cancer. PERFORMANCE: Hybrid PET/MRI imaging has the potential to replace conventional imaging techniques in the future. ACHIEVEMENTS: The method is just starting the broad application. Clinical studies must be expanded in order to substantiate the additional value of the method. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Currently, there is still a low distribution situation, since it is a new and cost-intensive method. At the same time, there is still no consistent solution for reimbursement. The importance in practice first rises by clarifying the payment situation and further demonstration of the method's benefit by larger studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Der Radiologe","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D011471","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostate","uri":{"id":"D011467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatitis","uri":{"id":"D011472","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatism","uri":{"id":"D053448","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radionuclide Imaging","uri":{"id":"D011877","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Image Enhancement","uri":{"id":"D007089","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D011471","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Positron-Emission Tomography","uri":{"id":"D049268","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multimodal Imaging","uri":{"id":"D064847","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Humans","Image Enhancement","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Multimodal Imaging","Positron-Emission Tomography","Prostatic Neoplasms"]},"pmid":"23949436","title":"[Potential of PET/MRI for diagnosis of prostate cancer].","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were previously considered to only affect high-income countries. However, they now account for a very large burden in terms of both mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), although little is known about the impact these diseases have on households in these countries. In this paper, we present a literature review on the costs imposed by NCDs on households in LMICs. We examine both the costs of obtaining medical care and the costs associated with being unable to work, while discussing the methodological issues of particular studies. The results suggest that NCDs pose a heavy financial burden on many affected households; poor households are the most financially affected when they seek care. Medicines are usually the largest component of costs and the use of originator brand medicines leads to higher than necessary expenses. In particular, in the treatment of diabetes, insulin--when required--represents an important source of spending for patients and their families. These financial costs deter many people suffering from NCDs from seeking the care they need. The limited health insurance coverage for NCDs is reflected in the low proportions of patients claiming reimbursement and the low reimbursement rates in existing insurance schemes. The costs associated with lost income-earning opportunities are also significant for many households. Therefore, NCDs impose a substantial financial burden on many households, including the poor in low-income countries. The financial costs of obtaining care also impose insurmountable barriers to access for some people, which illustrates the urgency of improving financial risk protection in health in LMIC settings and ensuring that NCDs are taken into account in these systems. In this paper, we identify areas where further research is needed to have a better view of the costs incurred by households because of NCDs; namely, the extension of the geographical scope, the inclusion of certain diseases hitherto little studied, the introduction of a time dimension, and more comparisons with acute illnesses.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health research policy and systems / BioMed Central","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Absenteeism","Cardiovascular Diseases","Chronic Disease","Cost of Illness","Developing Countries","Diabetes Mellitus","Employment","Financing, Personal","Health Expenditures","Humans","Income","Neoplasms"]},"pmid":"23947294","title":"The financial burden from non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries: a literature review.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Recruitment to primary care trials, particularly those involving young children, is known to be difficult. There are limited data available to inform researchers about the effectiveness of different trial recruitment strategies and their associated costs. PURPOSE: To describe, evaluate, and investigate the costs of three strategies for recruiting febrile children to a community-based randomised trial of antipyretics. METHODS: The three recruitment strategies used in the trial were termed as follows: (1) 'local', where paediatric research nurses stationed in primary care sites invited parents of children to participate; (2) 'remote', where clinicians at primary care sites faxed details of potentially eligible children to the trial office; and (3) 'community', where parents, responding to trial publicity, directly contacted the trial office when their child was unwell. RESULTS: Recruitment rates increased in response to the sequential introduction of three recruitment strategies, which were supplemented by additional recruiting staff, flexible staff work patterns, and improved clinician reimbursement schemes. The three strategies yielded different randomisation rates. They also appeared to be interdependent and highly effective together. Strategy-specific costs varied from £297 to £857 per randomised participant and represented approximately 10% of the total trial budget. LIMITATIONS: Because the recruitment strategies were implemented sequentially, it was difficult to measure their independent effects. The cost analysis was performed retrospectively. CONCLUSIONS: Trial recruiter expertise and deployment of several interdependent, illness-specific strategies were key factors in achieving rapid recruitment of young children to a community-based randomised controlled trial (RCT). The 'remote' recruitment strategy was shown to be more cost-effective compared to 'community' and 'local' strategies in the context of this trial. Future trialists should report recruitment costs to facilitate a transparent evaluation of recruitment strategy cost-effectiveness.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Clinical trials (London,

Although post-program evaluations of program content were conducted at the time of program delivery, little is known about translation of these learned skills into clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This research sought to describe levels of self-reported participant confidence in anticoagulation management; development, implementation, and performance management of both core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current anticoagulation clinical practices subsequent to participating in the Anticoagulation Training Program. SETTING: A federal Indian Health Service healthcare facility in Oklahoma, USA. METHODS: A cross-sectional, electronic mail survey was designed, pretested, and administered to 267 eligible Anticoagulation Training Program participants from 1999 to 2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information about confidence in anticoagulation management skills; development, implementation and improvement of both core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current anticoagulation clinical practices was collected. RESULTS: After training, over 90 % of participants reported agreement/strong agreement with statements about confidence in performing patient-care related anticoagulation activities. A smaller proportion (83.3-85.4 %) reported agreement/strong agreement with confidence in measuring, analyzing and reporting anticoagulation outcomes. Improvement activities were more common than development or implementation activities (65.4, 31.9 and 35.1 %, respectively). Not having well established reimbursement procedures, lack of dedicated clinic space, and lack of dedicated personnel salaries (47.3, 38.3 and 32.6 %, respectively) were reported as the most common barriers to developing, implementing or improving an anticoagulation clinic. Participants indicated that anticoagulation outcomes tracking was the most common supplemental development, implementation and improvement activity (37.9, 37.0 and 43.8 % respectively). Benchmarking was the least commonly reported outcomes-related activity by participants (33.6 %). Although there was only a modest gain in the number of established anticoagulation clinics after attending the Anticoagulation Training Program, approximately 21 % of participants reported using skills learned to establish other disease state management clinics. CONCLUSION: In general, a majority of participants reported high levels of confidence related to direct patient care activities after attending the Anticoagulation Training Program. However there is a need to raise confidence in performance improvement and outcomes management activities to align with current accreditation standards in anticoagulation management as the Anticoagulation Training Program evolves.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of clinical

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: To mitigate shortages of primary care physicians and ensure access to health care services for a growing number of Medicare beneficiaries, some policy makers have recommended expanding the supply and roles of nurse practitioners (NPs). Little is known about the number of NPs billing Medicare or their practice patterns. PURPOSE: This study examines the geographic distribution and county characteristics of NPs billing Medicare, compares the types and quantities of primary care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by NPs and primary care physicians, and analyzes the characteristics of beneficiaries receiving primary care from each type of clinician. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2008 Medicare administrative data from 959,848 aged and/or disabled beneficiaries continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare during the study period. Outcome measures included geographic distribution of NPs measured by the rate of NPs per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries by state, average utilization, and patient characteristics. DISCUSSION: States with the highest rate of NPs billing were rural. Over 80% of the payments received by both NPs and primary care physicians were for evaluation and management services. Beneficiaries assigned to an NP were more likely to be female, to be dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and to have qualified for Medicare because of a disability. NPs with assigned beneficiaries were significantly more likely than similar primary care physicians to practice in federally designated primary care shortage areas. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 45,000 NPs were providing services to beneficiaries and billing under their own provider numbers in 2008. Aspects of NP practice patterns were different from primary care physicians, and NPs appeared more likely to provide services to disadvantaged Medicare beneficiaries.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nursing outlook","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Clinical Protocols","uri":{"id":"D002985","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice, Inbred C57BL","uri":{"id":"D008810","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Flow Cytometry","uri":{"id":"D005434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perfusion Imaging","uri":{"id":"D055420","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microscopy, Confocal","uri":{"id":"D018613","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fluorescence","uri":{"id":"D005453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microscopy","uri":{"id":"D008853","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Netherlands","uri":{"id":"D009426","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perfusion","uri":{"id":"D010477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rest","uri":{"id":"D012146","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rodentia","uri":{"id":"D012377","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mice","uri":{"id":"D051379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Catheters","uri":{"id":"D057785","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dipyridamole","uri":{"id":"D004176","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microspheres","uri":{"id":"D008863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis","uri":{"id":"D010323","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vasodilator Agents","uri":{"id":"D014665","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Aged","Cross-Sectional Studies","Databases, Factual","Female","Humans","Male","Medicare","Nurse Practitioners","Nurse's Practice Patterns","Physician's Practice Patterns","Physicians, Primary Care","Primary Health Care","Professional Practice Location","Reimbursement Mechanisms","Socioeconomic Factors","United States"]},"pmid":"23870733","title":"Using Medicare data to assess nurse practitioner-provided care.","year":"2013 Nov-Dec"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The atopy patch test (APT) is defined as a patch test procedure to assess delayed type hypersensitivity reactions against those protein allergens known to elicit IgE-mediated type I reactions in atopic patients. This patch test procedure uses intact protein allergens instead of haptens in an optimized test setting and with a special reading key. It may be clinically useful especially for atopic dermatitis, as the currently available test procedures either target the wrong reaction type (type I and not type IV) or use the wrong allergens (haptens and not protein allergen). A positive APT reaction correlates with a positive lymphocyte transformation test and allergen-specific Th2 cells in the peripheral blood. As even small changes in the test procedure influence the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the APT, the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) has developed a standardized APT technique: Intact protein allergens, purified in petrolatum, are applied in 12-mm-diameter Finn chambers mounted on Scanpor tape for 48 h to non-irritated, non-abraded, or tape-stripped skin of the upper back for 48 h; the evaluation of the test reaction is done after 48 and 72 h using the ETFAD reading key, assessing erythema as well as number and distribution pattern of the papules. The APT may reveal type IV sensitization in patients who are negative for the respective type I tests. Limited availability of the expensive test substances and limited reimbursement is among the factors restricting the routine use of the APT.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current allergy and

Compared with Medicare FFS patients, Medicare Advantage patients had lower age-, sex-, race-, and income-adjusted procedure rates per 1000 person-years for angiography (16.5 [95% CI, 14.8-18.2] vs 25.9 [95% CI, 24.0-27.9]; P < .001) and PCI (6.8 [95% CI, 6.0-7.6] vs 9.8 [95% CI, 9.0-10.6]; P < .001) but similar rates for CABG surgery (3.1 [95% CI, 2.8-3.5] vs 3.4 [95% CI, 3.1-3.7]; P = .33). There were no significant differences between Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS patients in the rates per 1000 person-years of urgent angiography (3.9 [95% CI, 3.6-4.2] vs 4.3 [95% CI, 4.0-4.6]; P = .24) or PCI (2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] vs 2.7 [95% CI, 2.5-2.9]; P = .16). Procedure rates varied widely across hospital referral regions among Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS patients. For angiography, the rates per 1000 person-years ranged from 9.8 to 40.6 for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and from 15.7 to 44.3 for Medicare FFS beneficiaries. For PCI, the rates ranged from 3.5 to 16.8 for Medicare Advantage and from 4.7 to 16.1 for Medicare FFS. The rates for CABG surgery ranged from 1.5 to 6.1 for Medicare Advantage and from 2.5 to 6.0 for Medicare FFS. Across regions, we found no statistically significant correlation between Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS beneficiary utilization for angiography (Spearman r = 0.19, P = .29) and modest correlations for PCI (Spearman r = 0.33, P = .06) and CABG surgery (Spearman r = 0.35, P = .05). Among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, adjustment for additional cardiac risk factors had little influence on procedure rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in capitated Medicare Advantage programs had lower angiography and PCI procedure rates than those enrolled in Medicare FFS, the degree of geographic variation in procedure rates was substantial among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and was similar in magnitude to that observed among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"JAMA","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Age Factors","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Capitation Fee","Coronary Angiography","Coronary Artery Bypass","Cross-Sectional Studies","Fee-for-Service Plans","Female","Geography","Humans","Male","Medicare","Medicare Part C","Percutaneous Coronary Intervention","Reimbursement, Incentive","Sex Factors","United States"]},"pmid":"23839749","title":"Geographic variation in cardiovascular procedure use among Medicare fee-for-service vs Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.","year":"2013"}

SUMMARY ANSWER: The Belgian national register shows that the introduction of reimbursement of ART laboratory costs in July 2003, and the imposition of a legal limitation of the number of embryos transferred in the same year, were associated with a >50% reduction of the multiple pregnancy rate from 27 to 11% between 2003 and the last assessment in 2010, without any reduction of the pregnancy rate per cycle. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Individual Belgian IVF centres have published their results since the implementation of the law, and these show a decrease in the multiple pregnancy rate on a centre by centre basis. However, the overall national picture remains unpublished. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study from 1990 to 2010 of all ART cycles in Belgium (2685 cycles in 1990 evolving to 19 110 cycles in 2010), with a retrospective analysis from 1990 to 2000 and prospective online data collection since 2001. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Registration evolved from paper written reports per centre to a compulsory online registration of all ART cycles. From 2001 up to mid-2009, data were collected from Excel spread sheets or MS Access files into an MS Access database. Since mid-2009, data collection is done via a remote and secured web-based system (www.belrap.be) where centres can upload their data and get immediate feedback about missing data, errors and inconsistencies. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: National Belgian registration data show that reimbursement of IVF laboratory costs in July 2003, coupled to a legal limitation in the number of embryos transferred in utero, were associated with a 50% reduction of the multiple pregnancy rate from 27 to 11% without reduction of the pregnancy rate per cycle, and with an increase in the number of fresh and frozen ART cycles due to improved access to treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is potential underreporting of complications of ART treatment, pregnancy outcome and neonatal health. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Over the 20 years of registration, the pregnancy rate has remained constant, despite the reduction in the number of embryos transferred, optimization of laboratory procedures and stimulation protocols, introduction of quality systems and implementation of the EU Tissue Directive over the period 2004-2010. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No external funding was sought for this study.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) have served the primary healthcare needs of the medically underserved in US rural areas for more than 30 years. As a new model of healthcare delivery, the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) offers potential opportunities for addressing the healthcare needs of rural populations, yet little is known about how the ACO model will meet the needs of RHCs. This article reports on the results of a survey, focus groups, and phone interviews with RHC management personnel on the subject of benefits of and barriers to RHC participation in ACOs. METHODS: Survey research, focus groups, and phone interviews were used to gather and analyze the opinions of RHCs' management about the benefits of and barriers to ACO participation. The study population consisted of all 2011 RHCs in Region 4 (Southeastern USA; as designated by the Department of Health and Human Services). California RHCs were used for comparison. Themes and concepts for the survey questionnaire were developed from recent literature. The survey data were analyzed in two stages: (1) analyses of the characteristics of the RHCs and their responses; and (2) bivariate analyses of several relationships using a variety of statistics including analysis of variance, Pearson's &#967;² and likelihood &#967;². Relationships were examined between the RHCs' willingness to join ACOs and the respondent clinic's classification (as provider-based or independent). In addition, willingness to join ACOs among Region 4 RHCs was compared with those in California. Finally, in order to gain a broader understanding of the results of the survey, focus groups and phone interviews were conducted with RHC personnel. RESULTS: It was found that the<b> </b>ACO model is generally unfamiliar to RHCs. Approximately 48% of the survey respondents reported having little knowledge of ACOs; the focus group participants and interviewees likewise reported a lack of knowledge. Among respondents who were knowledgeable about ACOs, the most frequently citied potential benefit of ACOs (58%) was improved patient quality of care, followed by a focus on the patient (54%). More than half of the respondents (53%) cited 'financing' as a deterrent to RHC participating in ACOs. Many (43%) reported that their clinic had inadequate capital to improve their information technology systems. Another 51% cited legal and regulatory barriers. CONCLUSIONS: While the ACO model was unfamiliar to many of the RHC study participants, many suggested that ACOs may promote the quality of health care for RHC patients and their communities. If, on the other hand, RHCs are not provided the necessary technical assistance or not valued as ACO partners, ACOs may not improve the services that RHCs provide. As the ACO model evolves, the authors will determine whether it will benefit RHCs and their patients, or how the ACO must be modified to accommodate the unique needs of RHCs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Rural and remote health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Accountable Care Organizations","Administrative Personnel","Female","Focus Groups","Group Practice","Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice","Humans","Interviews as Topic","Male","Medicaid","Medically Underserved Area","Medicare","Organizational Culture","Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","Professional Role","Reimbursement, Incentive","Rural Health Services","United States"]},"pmid":"23808801","title":"Accountable care organizations: benefits and barriers as perceived by Rural Health Clinic management.","year":"2013 Apr-Jun"}

OBJECTIVE: To assess U.S. physicians' impressions about the direction of U.S. health care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), whether that legislation will make reimbursement more or less fair, and examine how those judgments relate to political affiliation and perceived social responsibility. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, mailed, self-reported survey. PARTICIPANTS: Simple random sample of 3,897 U.S. physicians. MAIN MEASURES: Views on the ACA in general, reimbursement under the ACA in particular, and perceived social responsibility. KEY RESULTS: Among 2,556 physicians who responded (RR2: 65 %), approximately two out of five (41 %) believed that the ACA will turn U.S. health care in the right direction and make physician reimbursement less fair (44 %). Seventy-two percent of physicians endorsed a general professional obligation to address societal health policy issues, 65 % agreed that every physician is professionally obligated to care for the uninsured or underinsured, and half (55 %) were willing to accept limits on coverage for expensive drugs and procedures for the sake of expanding access to basic health care. In multivariable analyses, liberals and independents were both substantially more likely to endorse the ACA (OR 33.0 [95 % CI, 23.6-46.2]; OR 5.0 [95 % CI, 3.7-6.8], respectively), as were physicians reporting a salary (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.2-2.5]) or salary plus bonus (OR 1.4 [95 % CI, 1.1-1.9) compensation type. In the same multivariate models, those who agreed that addressing societal health policy issues are within the scope of their professional obligations (OR 1.5 [95 % CI, 1.0-2.0]), who believe physicians are professionally obligated to care for the uninsured / under-insured (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.3-2.4]), and who agreed with limiting coverage for expensive drugs and procedures to expand insurance coverage (OR 2.3 [95 % CI, 1.8-3.0]), were all significantly more likely to endorse the ACA. Surgeons and procedural specialists were less likely to endorse it (OR 0.5 [95 % CI, 0.4-0.7], OR 0.6 [95 % CI, 0.5-0.9], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Significant subsets of U.S. physicians express concerns about the direction of U.S. health care under recent health care reform legislation.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Retaining participants in observational longitudinal studies after bariatric surgery is difficult yet critical because the retention rate affects interpretation and generalizability of results. Strategies for keeping participants involved in such studies are not commonly published. The objective of this study was to review LABS retention strategies and present the 24-month retention data. METHODS: The LABS Consortium monitors an observational cohort study of 2458 adults enrolled before bariatric surgery at 10 centers within the United States (LABS-2). To maximize data completeness, the investigators developed retention strategies, including flexible scheduling, a call protocol, reminder letters, abbreviated visit options, honoraria, travel reimbursement, providing research progress reports, laboratory results, newsletters, study website, and retention surveys. Strategies for locating participants included frequent updates of contact information, sending registered letters, and searching medical and public records. RESULTS: At 12 and 24 months, 2426 and 2405 participants remained active, with vital status known for 98.7% and 97.3% and weight obtained for 95.2% and 92.2%, respectively. There were 148 missed visits (6.2%) at 24 months primarily because of inability to contact the participant. Only 15 (0.6%) active participants at 24 months missed all follow-up visits. Although 42 participants could not be located or contacted at 6 months, data were obtained for 23 (54.7%) of them at 12 months, and of the 52 participants who could not be located or contacted at 12 months, data were obtained for 18 (34.6%) at 24 months. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal studies provide the ability to evaluate long-term effects of bariatric surgical procedures. The retention achieved in LABS is superior to that of many published reports but requires extensive effort and resources. This report identifies useful retention strategies. Further research is needed to identify the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of specific retention strategies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the prevalence of malnutrition risk and assessed malnutrition in patients admitted to a cancer-specific public hospital, and to model the potential hospital funding opportunity associated with implementing routine malnutrition screening. METHODS: A point-prevalence audit of malnutrition risk and diagnosable malnutrition was conducted. A retrospective audit of hospital funding associated with documented cases of malnutrition was conducted. Audit results were used to estimate annual malnutrition prevalence, associated casemix-based reimbursement potential and the clinical support resources required to adequately identify and treat malnutrition. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of inpatients were at risk of malnutrition. Of these, 90% were assessed as malnourished. Twelve percent of malnourished patients produced a positive change in the diagnosis-related group (DRG) and increased allocated financial reimbursement. Identifying and diagnosing all cases of malnutrition could contribute an additional AU$413644 reimbursement funding annually. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of malnutrition may expedite appropriate nutritional management and improve patient outcomes in addition to contributing to casemix-based reimbursement funding for health services. A successful business case for additional clinical resources to improve nutritional care was aided by demonstrating the link between malnutrition screening, hospital reimbursements and improved nutritional care. What is known about the topic? It is known that between 20 and 50% of hospital patients are malnourished and oncology patients are 1.7 times more likely to be malnourished than are other hospitalised patients. Despite the existence of practice guidelines for malnutrition screening of at-risk oncology patients, these are not routinely implemented. Identification of malnutrition in hospitalised patients is linked to casemix funding via DRG. Casemix reimbursement for malnutrition can be enhanced if: (1) malnutrition risk is identified; (2) malnutrition is diagnosed; (3) the word 'malnutrition' and an associated action plan is documented in the medical record; and (4) malnutrition is recognised and recorded by the clinical coder. Amendments to the ICD-10-AM in 2008 allowing malnutrition to be recognised as a complication for coding when it is documented by a dietitian in the medical history has hospital reimbursement implications for dietetic practice. Reimbursement potential for malnutrition has been calculated in public hospitals in Australia with varying results. What does this paper add? This paper reports the components of a successful business case made to enhance resources for identification and treatment of malnutrition on the basis of improved treatment as well as enhanced reimbursement potential resulting from changes to the ICD-10-AM. The present study adds to the body of literature showing that malnutrition coding contributes to casemix funding in Australian public hospitals, as well as internationally, and highlights the previously unreported opportunity for a cancer-specific health service. This work demonstrated that reassignment of a DRG based on a diagnosis of malnutrition altered the overall casemix funding value for 12% of audited patients. This compares with the findings of other authors who demonstrated hypothetical DRG changes and financial reallocation. What are the implications for practitioners? This paper highlights that practitioner-centred strategies are needed to enhance malnutrition identification, diagnosis, documentation and coding to maximise casemix reimbursement and better treat malnutrition in hospitals. Strategies include education of the dietetics, medical and health-information workforce. This manuscript provides a description of the conduct of quality-improvement activities that may support successful business cases for increased dietetic resources in future.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Dental visits represent an opportunity to identify and assist patients with unhealthy substance use, but little is known about how dentists are addressing patients' use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. The authors surveyed dentists to learn about the role their practices might play in providing substance-use screening and interventions. METHODS: The authors distributed a 41-item Web-based survey to all 210 dentists active in the Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning Network, a practice-based research network. The questionnaire assessed dental practices' policies and current practices, attitudes and perceived barriers to providing services for tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three dentists completed the survey (68 percent response rate). Although screening was common, fewer dentists reported that they were providing follow-up counseling or referrals for substance use. Insufficient knowledge or training was the most frequently cited barrier to intervention. Many dentists reported they would offer assistance for use of tobacco (67 percent) or alcohol or illicit drugs (52 percent) if reimbursed; respondents who treated publicly insured patients were more likely to reply that they would offer this assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists recognize the importance of screening for substance use, but they lack the clinical training and practice-based systems focused on substance use that could facilitate intervention. Practical Implications. The results of this study indicate that dentists may be willing to address substance use among patients, including use of alcohol and illicit drugs in addition to tobacco, if barriers are reduced through changes in reimbursement, education and systems-level support.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Dental Association

AIMS: To quantify FD patients' health care utilisation patterns and to estimate direct and indirect costs of FD to patients. METHODS: ICD-9 codes identified adult patients with dyspepsia. A validated questionnaire was mailed to patients who met Rome III criteria for FD. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-five patients met all inclusion criteria. The response rate was 63%. The respondents' mean age was 50 (14) years; 75% were women; 52% of respondents rated their FD as moderate. Patients reported 3 visits (mean) to their PCP over 12 months; 75% reported having blood work, 92% an EGD, 59% an ultrasound and 40% a CT scan. The direct cost of testing using Medicare reimbursement rates per patient was $582. To treat FD symptoms, 89% tried dietary changes, 89% over-the-counter medications, 87% prescription medications and 25% alternative therapies. Mean patient expenditure over the last year was $246 for OTC medications (range $0-12,000), $290 for co-payments (range $0-9,000) and $110 for alternative treatments (range $0-3,741). Total mean direct cost yearly to patients was $699. In the 7 days prior to completing the questionnaire, respondents reported a mean of 1.4 h absence from work. Extrapolating the results to the US population, we conservatively calculate the costs of FD were $18.4 billion in 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Functional dyspepsia patients incur significant direct and indirect costs and work productivity is impaired by dyspeptic symptoms.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Alimentary

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service adapted a list from the National Quality Forum consisting of 10 hospital-acquired conditions, also known as never events. Deeming such events as preventable in a safe-hospital setting, reimbursement is no longer provided for treatments arising secondary to these events. A retrospective chart review identified 90 panniculectomy and abdominoplasty patients. The hospital-acquired conditions examined include surgical-site infections (SSI), vascular-catheter associated infections, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, retained foreign body, catheter-related urinary tract infection, manifestations of poor glycemic control, falls and trauma, air embolism, pressure ulcers (stages III and IV), and blood incompatibility. Information regarding age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, body mass index, smoking, and chemotherapy were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups, namely, those who developed never events and those with no events. Of the 90 patients, 14 (15.5%) developed never events because of SSI. No events occurred in the remaining 9 categories. Statistically significant risk factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, age, and diabetes mellitus. The most common never event was SSI. In light of the obvious prevalence of the risk factors in patients who develop these events, the question of whether never events are truly unavoidable arises. Despite this, awareness of the impact on patient care, health care and hospital reimbursement is vital to understanding the new paradigm of the \"one size fits all.\"","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Annals of plastic

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: In mainland China, the motivation behind voluntary blood donation is a relatively new and understudied behavior. In recent times provincial governments in China have implemented various institutional incentive measures. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of such measures. This qualitative study investigated the nature and outcomes of some identified institutionalized mechanisms, in particular how these were created and distributed in the form of incentives for voluntary blood donation. METHODS: Participatory observations were conducted at two blood donation stations and four blood collecting vehicles in Changsha city, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 staff and 58 blood donors at the aforementioned venues from May to October 2008 in Changsha. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed the operation of four primary type incentives: policy-driven, symbolic, information feedback and role models, which constituted the system of institutional incentives. The current blood reimbursement system was not the primary motivation for blood donation; instead this system was a subtheme of future assurance for emergency blood needs. It was evident that symbolic incentives stressed the meaning and value of blood donation. Furthermore, post-donation information services and the inherent mechanisms of communication, enhanced by some public role models, served to draw the public to donate blood. CONCLUSIONS: At the institutional level, blood donation was not only informed by altruism, but also carried a system of benefit and reward for the donors and their family members. We would recommend that such arrangements, if accommodated effectively into China's health promotion strategies, would increase the likelihood of blood donation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC public

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: There are potential conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially where there are safety and/or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies have shown dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. There are also issues with potentially re-designing anticoagulant services. This has resulted in activities across countries to better manage its use. OBJECTIVE: To (i) review authority activities in over 30 countries and regions, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications for all major stakeholder groups. METHODOLOGY: Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran and the development of guidance for groups through an iterative process. RESULTS: There has been a plethora of activities among authorities to manage the prescribing of dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions, and monitoring of prescribing post-launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: Access to health care remains a major problem in Senegal, particularly among vulnerable groups such as the elderly. In 2006, the Senegalese government introduced a national plan for the provision of free health care known as \"Plan Sésame\" to improve access to care. The purpose of this study was to examine the current state of the \"Plan Sésame\" in national hospitals four years after its implementation (2006-2009). METHODS: A qualitative study using individual interviews was conducted between 15 March and 14 May 2010 among five target populations: hospital directors, health care providers, managers of the \"Plan Sésame\" in hospital admission services, management accountants, and beneficiaries. Content analysis was used. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2008, hospital attendance rates increased every year. However, attendance rates began to decrease in 2009, except in the main hospital. The state has been left with a growing debt because of issues surrounding the reimbursement of expenses related to the \"Plan Sésame'. As a result, national hospitals have been forced to restrict certain services included in the \"Plan Sésame\" and even to withdraw free health care for the elderly. These difficulties are likely to undermine the sustainability of the \"Plan Sésame\" CONCLUSION: The health authorities need to audit the \"Plan Sésame:, to comply with standard procedures through regular monitoring and to redefine conditions of access.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Santé publique (Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Managed Care Programs","uri":{"id":"D008329","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Personnel","uri":{"id":"D006282","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services Accessibility","uri":{"id":"D006297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services Needs and Demand","uri":{"id":"D006301","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Autonomy","uri":{"id":"D026684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health","uri":{"id":"D006262","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Senegal","uri":{"id":"D012675","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services for the Aged","uri":{"id":"D006299","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Senegal","uri":{"id":"D012675","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uncompensated Care","uri":{"id":"D017664","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Aged","Health Services for the Aged","Humans","Senegal","Uncompensated Care"]},"pmid":"23705341","title":"[Analysis of free health care for the elderly in the context of the \"Plan Sésame\" in Senegal].","year":"2013 Jan-Feb"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate, yet little is known of the impact this increase will have on society. We sought to determine the clinical and economic burden of a sustained increase in thyroid cancer incidence in the United States and to understand how these burdens correlate with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) prioritization of thyroid cancer research funding. METHODS: We used the NCI's SEER 13 database (1992-2009) and Joinpoint regression software to identify the current clinical burden of thyroid cancer and to project future incidence through 2019. We combined Medicare reimbursement rates with American Thyroid Association guidelines, and our clinical practice to create an economic model of thyroid cancer. We obtained research-funding data from the NCI's Office of Budget and Finance. RESULTS; By 2019, papillary thyroid cancer will double in incidence and become the third most common cancer in women of all ages at a cost of $18 to $21 billion dollars in the United States. Despite these substantial clinical and economic burdens, thyroid cancer research remains significantly underfunded by comparison, and in 2009 received only $14.7 million (ranked 30th) from the NCI. CONCLUSION: The impact of thyroid cancer on society has been significantly underappreciated, as is evidenced by its low priority in national research funding levels. IMPACT: Increased awareness in the medical community and the general public of the societal burden of thyroid cancer, and substantial increases in research on thyroid cancer etiology, prevention, and treatment are needed to offset these growing concerns.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The implementation of national estimated glomerular filatration rate reporting and the inclusion of renal-specific indicators in a primary care pay for performance (P4P) system since April 2006 has promoted identification and better management of risk factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the UK, the P4P framework is known as the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). One of the key targets for intervention in primary care was hypertension. It is clear that hypertension is a major predictor of development and progression of CKD; thus, targeting better blood pressure control is likely to have a positive impact on outcomes in CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of renal indicators outlined in P4P on the management of hypertension in primary care. To estimate the cost implications of the resulting changes in prescribing patterns of antihypertensive medication following introduction of such indicators. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study using a large primary care database. This cohort was taken from a database collated as part of a clinical decision support system used to assist the management of CKD in primary care. We investigated a total population of 90 250 individuals on general practitioner (GP) registers with a valid serum creatinine estimation in the 6-year study period. A total of 10 040 patients had confirmed stage 3-5 CKD in the 2 years pre-QOF and formed the study cohort. Patients were studied over three time periods, pre-QOF (1 April 2004 to 31 March 2006), 2 years post-QOF (1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008) and finally the two subsequent years (1 April 2008 to 31 March 2010). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) together with antihypertensive medication were analysed over the three time periods. Cost calculation was based on 2009 British National Formulary list prices for antihypertensives. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort at the start of the study period was 64.8 years, 55% were female. In those patients with stage 3-5 CKD 83.9% were hypertensive, defined by a pre-P4P BP of >140/85 or currently taking antihypertensive medication. The proportion of patients with CKD 3-5 attaining the BP target of 145/80 increased from 41.5% in the pre-QOF period to 50.0% in the post-QOF period. This increase was even more marked for those with hypertension in the pre-QOF period (28.8-45.1%). In the hypertensive patients, mean BP fell from 146/79 mmHg to 140/76 in the first 2 years post-P4P [P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. This BP reduction was sustained in the last 2 years of the study, 139/75 (P < 0.01, ANOVA). The proportion of hypertensive patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin blockers increased, this was also sustained in the third time period. An increase in the prescribing of diuretics, calcium channel blockers and β-blockers was also observed. The additional cost of increased prescribing was calculated to be €25.00 per hypertensive patient based on GP prescription data. CONCLUSIONS: Population BP control has improved since the introduction of P4P renal indicators, and this improvement has been sustained. This was associated with a significant increase in the use of antihypertensive medication, resulting in increased prescription cost. Longer-term follow-up will establish whether or not this translates to improved outcomes in terms of progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease and patient mortality.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Aged","Antihypertensive Agents","Blood Pressure Determination","Case-Control Studies","Disease Progression","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Glomerular Filtration Rate","Humans","Hypertension","Kidney Failure, Chronic","Kidney Function Tests","Longitudinal Studies","Male","Middle Aged","Prognosis","Reimbursement, Incentive","Retrospective Studies","Risk Factors"]},"pmid":"23658247","title":"The impact of pay for performance on the control of blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease stage 3-5.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Bundled payment entails paying a single price for all services delivered as part of an episode of care for a specific condition. It is seen as a promising way to slow the growth of health care spending while maintaining or improving the quality of care. To implement bundled payment, policy makers must set base payment rates for episodes of care and update the rates over time to reflect changes in the costs of delivering care and the components of care. Adopting the fee-for-service paradigm of adjusting payments with uniform update rates would be fair and accurate if costs increased at a uniform rate across episodes. But our analysis of 2003 and 2007 US commercial claims data showed spending growth to be highly skewed across episodes: 10 percent of episodes accounted for 82.5 percent of spending growth, and within-episode spending growth ranged from a decline of 75 percent to an increase of 323 percent. Given that spending growth was much faster for some episodes than for others, a situation known as skewness, policy makers should not update episode payments using uniform update rates. Rather, they should explore ways to address variations in spending growth, such as updating episode payments one by one, at least at the outset.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health affairs (Project Hope)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Adolescent","Adult","Episode of Care","Female","Health Care Costs","Health Expenditures","Health Policy","Humans","Male","Medicaid","Medicare","Middle Aged","Patient Care Bundles","Policy Making","Reimbursement Mechanisms","United States","Young Adult"]},"pmid":"23650329","title":"Policy makers will need a way to update bundled payments that reflects highly skewed spending growth of various care episodes.","year":"2013"}

Our objective was to investigate the trend in parathyroidectomy rates between 2001 and 2010, and to evaluate if the availability and reimbursement of cinacalcet modified that trend. METHODS: Using a provincial administrative database, we included all adult patients receiving chronic dialysis treatments between 2001 and 2010 (incident and prevalent) in a time series analysis. The effect of cinacalcet availability on parathyroidectomy bimonthly rates was modeled using an ARIMA intervention model using different cut-off dates: September 2004 (Health Canada cinacalcet approval), January 2005, June 2005, January 2006, June 2006 (date of cinacalcet provincial reimbursement), and January 2007. RESULTS: A total of 12 795 chronic dialysis patients (mean age 64 years, 39% female, 82% hemodialysis) were followed for a mean follow-up of 3.3 years. During follow-up, 267 parathyroidectomies were identified, translating to an average rate of 7.0 per 1000 person-years. The average parathyroidectomy rate before cinacalcet availability was 11.4 /1000 person-years, and 3.6 /1000 person-years after cinacalcet public formulary listing. Only January 2006 as an intervention date in the ARIMA model was associated with a change in parathyroidectomy rates (estimate: -5.58, p = 0.03). Other intervention dates were not associated with lower parathyroidectomy rates. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in rates of parathyroidectomy was found after January 2006, corresponding to cinacalcet availability. However, decreased rates may be due to other factors occurring simultaneously with cinacalcet introduction and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC nephrology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Canada","uri":{"id":"D002170","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dialysis","uri":{"id":"D003956","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Renal Dialysis","uri":{"id":"D006435","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parathyroidectomy","uri":{"id":"D016105","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chronology as Topic","uri":{"id":"D002910","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemistry, Pharmaceutical","uri":{"id":"D002626","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Follow-Up Studies","uri":{"id":"D005500","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Middle Aged","uri":{"id":"D008875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Renal Dialysis","uri":{"id":"D006435","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary","uri":{"id":"D006962","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Naphthalenes","uri":{"id":"D009281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parathyroidectomy","uri":{"id":"D016105","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Aged","Chemistry, Pharmaceutical","Cohort Studies","Female","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary","Male","Middle Aged","Naphthalenes","Parathyroidectomy","Renal Dialysis","Treatment Outcome"]},"pmid":"23642012","title":"Effect of cinacalcet availability and formulary listing on parathyroidectomy rate trends.","year":"2013"}

However, implementation of this guidance has not been widespread and little is known of the characteristics of hospitals with screening practices in place. We assessed how screening practices vary with hospital characteristics. METHODS: We used a national hospital survey of HIV testing practices, linked to HIV prevalence for the county, parish, borough, or city where the hospital was located, to assess HIV screening of some or all patients by hospitals. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the association between screening practices and hospital characteristics that were significantly associated with screening in bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 376 hospitals in areas of prevalence ≥0.1%, only 25 (6.6%) reported screening all patients for HIV and 131 (34.8%) reported screening some or all patients. Among 638 hospitals included, screening some or all patients was significantly (p<0.05) more common at teaching hospitals, hospitals with higher numbers of annual admissions, and hospitals with a high proportion of Medicaid admissions. In multivariable analysis, screening some or all patients was independently associated with admitting more than 15% of Medicaid patients and receiving resources or reimbursement for screening tests. CONCLUSION: We found that few hospitals surveyed reported screening some or all patients, and failure to screen is common across all types of hospitals in all regions of the country. Expanded reimbursement for screening may increase compliance with the recommendations.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Quality compensation programs (QCPs), also known as pay-for-performance programs, are becoming more common within managed care entities. QCPs are believed to yield better patient outcomes, yet the programs lack the evidence needed to support these claims. We evaluated a QCP offered to network primary care physicians (PCPs) within a Medicare managed care plan to determine if a positive correlation between outcomes and the program exists. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of heart failure members under the care of PCPs enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) Plan QCP with those who are not affiliated with a QCP. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on the heart failure population of a MAPD in Texas. Heart failure members were identified using ICD-9-CM codes from inpatient and outpatient claims for 2010. These members must have been continuously eligible all 12 months of the year to be included in the analysis. The primary intervention was enrollment by the member's PCP into the QCP. Measurable outcomes included acute (hospital) admits, emergency room (ER) visits, appropriate laboratory tests, and prescriptions of medications that are evidence based and guideline driven. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) risk scores and comorbidities were used to risk-adjust outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 4,240 members was included in the analysis. From that population, 1,225 members (28.8%) were followed by PCPs enrolled in a QCP; 3,015 members (71.1%) were followed by PCPs not enrolled in a QCP. The adjusted analysis showed that none of the drug comparisons statistically differed between the QCP and non-QCP groups, whereas all of the lab tests, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and microalbumin, as well as the acquisition of the flu vaccine, occurred more frequently in the QCP group. Acute admits and ER visits in the QCP and non-QCP groups were similar before and after adjustment. The QCP group was significantly older with a statistically significant higher prevalence of renal failure and higher CMS risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: After evaluation of our QCP's impact on the quality of care provided to our Medicare beneficiaries, we have concluded that there is potential for health care improvement through pay-for-performance programs. We have observed in our MAPD heart failure population, enrolled in a QCP during the year of 2010, an increase in age and CMS risk scores, a decline in renal function, and noted the group to have a more female presence. Yet, the outcomes of this group (hospitalizations, ER visits, acquisition of lab tests, etc.) were similar when compared with younger, healthier members not enrolled in a QCP. We feel the clinical relevance of the data indicates that, overall, the quality of care is somewhat improved for QCP-enrolled providers when compared with non-QCP providers in regards to achieving certain quality metrics. (i.e., immunizations, HgA1c, LDL-C, etc.) Further research is definitely needed to determine if health care costs and clinical outcomes, in the long term, are improved for members enrolled in these QCP programs, as well as their impact upon a health plan's Medicare Star rating.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of managed care pharmacy :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Health economic evaluation (HEE) is increasingly used in healthcare decision-making on the allocation of limited resources in national healthcare systems. Although the methods used for HEE vary in different countries, all economic evaluations address two questions: Are limited resources used optimally? Is value for money achieved in their use? Our objective is to explain some fundamental concepts in HEE and how these concepts are adapted in different countries, notably in Germany. METHODS: We performed a bibliographic search to identify existing methods of health economic evaluation of new drugs used by the official agencies of 11 countries (Austria, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States and England and Wales) and compared them with that used by the German national agency IQWiG. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All countries considered follow internationally established standards of HEE. The majority of countries, including Germany, utilize primary outcome parameters such as disease-related morbidity and mortality for assessing relative efficacy and effectiveness. The most frequently recommended form of health economic evaluation is the cost-utility analysis (CUA). The German IQWIG is the only HTA body to use the cost-benefit concept of 'efficiency frontier' in its assessment. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: While the core principles of HEE are the same worldwide, there is a lack of harmonization in the details. This requires resource-consuming adaptations in the analyses to meet different national requirements. We describe the core principles of HEE as a common basis for further discussions by all stakeholders.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacy and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: Second-generation antipsychotics captured most of the U.S. antipsychotic market shortly after their introduction. Little is known about how second-generation antipsychotics have diffused in other countries with different health systems. The study objective was to describe trends in antipsychotic use in the United States and France from 1998 to 2008. METHODS: Pharmaceutical policies in France and the United States are briefly described, followed by descriptive data on quarterly prescriptions for oral antipsychotics dispensed between January 1998 and September 2008. Data are from Xponent for the United States and the GERS database for France. Trends in the use of first- versus second-generation antipsychotics and in ingredient formulations of second-generation antipsychotics used are reported. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2008, total antipsychotic use in the United States increased by 78%. Total use in France was consistently higher despite a 9% decrease during the period. By 2008, second-generation antipsychotics represented 86% of the antipsychotics sold in the U.S. market, versus only 40% of the French market. However, average annual growth rates in use of second-generation antipsychotics were similar in the two countries. In France, use of all but one second-generation antipsychotic steadily increased, whereas in the United States trends in the use of newer drugs varied substantially by drug. For example, use of olanzapine decreased after 2003, but use of quetiapine increased. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight markedly divergent trends in the diffusion of new antipsychotics in France and the United States. Some differences may be explained by differences in health systems; others may reflect physicians' preferences and norms of practice.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug and Narcotic Control","uri":{"id":"D004335","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diffusion","uri":{"id":"D004058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antipsychotic Agents","uri":{"id":"D014150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prescriptions","uri":{"id":"D055656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug and Narcotic Control","uri":{"id":"D004335","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"France","uri":{"id":"D005602","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Utilization","uri":{"id":"D004363","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"France","uri":{"id":"D005602","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physician's Practice Patterns","uri":{"id":"D010818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antipsychotic Agents","uri":{"id":"D014150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United States","uri":{"id":"D014481","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Disorders","uri":{"id":"D001523","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diffusion of Innovation","uri":{"id":"D004059","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug and Narcotic Control","uri":{"id":"D004335","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Prescriptions","uri":{"id":"D011307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reimbursement Mechanisms","uri":{"id":"D012051","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Adolescent","Adult","Antipsychotic Agents","Child","Diffusion of Innovation","Drug Prescriptions","Drug Utilization","Drug and Narcotic Control","France","Humans","Mental Disorders","Physician's Practice Patterns","Reimbursement Mechanisms","United States"]},"pmid":"23584568","title":"Diffusion of antipsychotics in the US And French markets, 1998-2008.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are among the most prevalent and costly chronic health conditions affecting the U.S. population. Prescription treatments for these conditions are of critical importance to the health of patients, yet suboptimal adherence to prescription treatments for these conditions is not uncommon. While monthly prescription restriction has become a commonly used mechanism to reduce medication utilization, little is known about the effect of this policy on patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.   OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a reimbursement limit implemented in the Louisiana Medicaid program that restricted patients receiving 8 prescriptions per month without prior authorization on continuation (persistence) of medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes.  METHODS: A pre-post design was applied using Medicaid claims data from 2001-2003 to compare medication persistence among patients in Louisiana (LA) to patients in Indiana (IN), a nonequivalent comparator state. Medication persistence was defined as time from treatment initiation to a treatment gap of 30 days or longer. To capture pre-intervention trends in medication persistence, we compared historical \"pre-policy\" cohorts in LA and IN followed for 10 months prior to policy adoption (March 3, 2002, to December 31, 2002) to \"post-policy\" cohorts followed for 10 months after policy adoption (March 3, 2003, to December 31, 2003). All incident cohorts were identified using a 6-month washout period. We used Cox-proportional hazard models to compare discontinuation rates in LA and IN across the pre-policy and policy period cohorts.  RESULTS: The adjusted results showed no differences in persistence during the pre-policy period between LA and IN for any of the 3 chronic conditions. In the post-policy period, patients with hyperlipidemia in LA were 1.13 (95% CI = 1.02-1.25; P  less than  0.05) times more likely to discontinue their treatment as their IN counterparts, while no significant differences were observed in the hypertension or diabetes cohorts.   CONCLUSION: Our study suggests there is inconclusive evidence that the monthly prescription restriction disrupts the continuation of medications for common chronic health conditions in patients. More research is needed to identify which patients are most vulnerable to the effect of monthly prescription limits and how this policy could potentially affect additional treatment outcomes such as medication adherence, health outcomes, and Medicaid expenditures. ","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of managed care pharmacy :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: To reach the French market, a new drug requires a marketing authorization (MA) and price and reimbursement agreements. These hurdles could delay access to new and promising drugs. Since 1992, French law authorizes the use of unlicensed drugs on an exceptional and temporary basis through a compassionate-use programme, known as Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU). This programme was implemented to improve early access to drugs under development or authorized abroad. However, it is suspected to be inflationary, bypassing public bodies in charge of health technology assessment (HTA) and of pricing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to observe the market access after the formal licensing of drugs that went through this compassionate-use programme. METHODS: We included all ATUs that received an MA between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2010. We first examined market access delays from these drugs using the standard administrative path. We positioned this result in relation to launch delays observed in France (for all outpatient drugs) and in other major European markets. Second, we assessed the bargaining power of a hospital purchaser after those drugs had obtained an MA by calculating the price growth rate after the approval. RESULTS: During the study period, 77 ATUs were formally licensed. The study concluded that, from the patient's perspective, licensing and public bodies' review time was shortened by a combined total of 36 months. The projected 11-month review time of public bodies may be longer than delays usually observed for outpatient drugs. Nonetheless, the study revealed significant benefits for French patient access based on comparable processing to launch time with those of other European countries with tight price control policies. In return, a 12 % premium, on average, is paid to pharmaceutical companies while drugs are under this status (sub-analysis on 56 drugs). CONCLUSIONS: In many instances, the ATU programme responds to a public health need by accelerating the availability of new drugs even though this study suggests an impact of the programme on the market access of these drugs for which the standard administrative path is longer than usual. In addition, pharmaceutical companies seem to market compassionate-use drugs with a presumed benefit/risk ratio at a price that guarantees a margin for future negotiation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PharmacoEconomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk

This idea is not at all impossible, for the instrument can be built today with means available right now. It is simply the well known telautograph, translated into radio terms, with additional refinements. The doctor of the future, by means of this instrument, will be able to feel his patient, as it were, at a distance...The doctor manipulates his controls, which are then manipulated at the patient's room in exactly the same manner. The doctor sees what is going on in the patient's room by means of a television screen.\" -Hugo Gernsback, Science and Invention Magazine, February 1925 Heart failure continues to be a major burden on our health care system. As the number of patients with heart failure increases, the cost of hospitalization alone is contributing significantly to the overall cost of this disease. Readmission rate and hospital length of stay are emerging as quality markers of heart failure care along with reimbursement policies that force hospitals to optimize these outcomes. Apart from maintaining quality assurance, the disease process of heart failure per-se requires demanding and close attention to vitals, diet, and medication compliance to prevent acute decompensation episodes. Remote patient monitoring is morphing into a key disease management strategy to optimize care for heart failure. Innovative implantable technologies to monitor intracardiac hemodynamics also are evolving, which potentially could offer better and substantial parameters to monitor.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Family history (FH) is considered an important factor to detect individuals at increased risk developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, FH information could be used to personalise risk messages, which are assumed to increase risk-reducing behaviours. In this study, we aimed to explore Dutch health care professionals' attitudes regarding current or future uptake of a more extensive use of FH information and the family system in diabetes prevention. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nineteen health care professionals from six general practices and four outpatient diabetes clinics. The use of FH information in opportunistic screening for T2D was explored, as well as the usability of a direct versus patient-mediated targeting strategy to reach persons with a FH of T2D. Three researchers analysed the interview transcripts separately. RESULTS: Dutch health care professionals considered FH an important risk factor in opportunistic screening for T2D. However, none of them used FH to promote risk-reducing behaviours. Directly targeting and educating patients known to have a FH of T2D was desirable for most primary care professionals, but not considered feasible. Findings indicated that FH information was not systematically gathered in primary care settings and electronic medical records were not equipped to retrieve persons with T2D running in their family. The idea of asking patients to pass on risk and preventive information was new to all interviewees, but was considered an acceptable strategy to reach persons with a FH of diabetes. Nevertheless, there were concerns about the accuracy of the messages delivered by the patients to their relatives. Practical barriers with regard to time, expertise, and financial reimbursement were also mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: There is great interest among healthcare professionals in primary as well as secondary care about the use of FH to prevent T2D, but there are significant barriers against such use. The removal of these barriers would depend on evidence showing the cost-effectiveness of FH-based strategies designed to prevent T2D.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC family

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"AIM: Prescription of psychotropic medicines carries risks to pregnancy. It is therefore appropriate to measure the prescription rate of these compounds in pregnant women. METHOD: We studied the prescription rate for psychotropic agents to pregnant women from the Cnamts medicines reimbursement data and we compared this to prescriptions in non-pregnant women in the same age group. RESULTS: There is a fall in the use of psychotropic agents in women during pregnancy compared to a non-pregnant population of the same age. Pregnant women receive 2.17 times less psychotropic agents. Nevertheless, approximately one out of every twenty women is prescribed a proprietary product with known risk to the neonate and four out of a thousand are prescribed a proprietary product which carries a risk of malformation during the first trimester. CONCLUSION: Medical practice takes account of embryo-fetal risk in prescribing psychotropic agents in general although more communication is needed about the risk of some compounds during pregnancy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Thérapie","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age Groups","uri":{"id":"D009273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnant Women","uri":{"id":"D037841","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy Trimester, First","uri":{"id":"D011261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant, Newborn","uri":{"id":"D007231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prescriptions","uri":{"id":"D055656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"France","uri":{"id":"D005602","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"France","uri":{"id":"D005602","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Infant, Newborn","uri":{"id":"D007231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Middle Aged","uri":{"id":"D008875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physician's Practice Patterns","uri":{"id":"D010818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Young Adult","uri":{"id":"D055815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy Trimester, First","uri":{"id":"D011261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychotropic Drugs","uri":{"id":"D011619","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Adolescent","Adult","Female","France","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Middle Aged","Physician's Practice Patterns","Pregnancy","Pregnancy Trimester, First","Psychotropic Drugs","Young Adult"]},"pmid":"23484658","title":"[Prescription of psychotropic medicines to pregnant women in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France].","year":"2013 Jan-Feb"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OPINION STATEMENT: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) creates a significant national and international healthcare burden. A first line treatment for PAD is supervised walking exercise in hospitals and clinics. Specifically, supervised walking exercise seeks to improve the classic symptom associated with PAD, intermittent claudication (IC), which is characterized by cramping, aching, and pain of the muscles in the lower extremities during walking. While effective, supervised walking exercise is often not prescribed or utilized due to a number of treatment barriers such as lack of transportation to clinical centers and lack of insurance reimbursement. Walking exercise in community settings is an option that has gained attention due to the limitations of supervised walking exercise, as community walking is generally more convenient in terms of a patient's schedule and may circumvent potential barriers such as treatment cost and transportation difficulties. However, more research is needed to improve the effectiveness of community-based walking programs since far less is known about the optimal structure of such programs. Other exercise therapy options are becoming available for PAD patients in addition to walking exercise. These modalities include but are not limited to leg and arm ergometry, polestriding and resistance training. These exercise therapy options have not to date been as well validated as supervised walking exercise. However, they may potentially be used in the event supervised walking exercise is not feasible or patient preference warrants an alternative exercise strategy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"23436041","title":"Exercise therapy for claudication: latest advances.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Episode-based payment, commonly referred to as bundled payment, has emerged as a key component of U.S. health care payment reform. Bundled payments are appealing as they share the financial risk of treating patients between payers and providers, encouraging the delivery of cost-effective care. A closely watched example is the U.S. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prospective Payment System, known as the 'expanded ESRD bundle.' In this paper we consider the expanded ESRD bundle 2 years after its implementation. First, we discuss emerging lessons, including how implementation has changed dialysis care with respect to the use of erythropoietin stimulating agents, how implementation has led to an increase in the use of home-based peritoneal dialysis, and how it may have contributed to the market consolidation of dialysis providers. Second, we use the expanded ESRD bundle to illustrate the importance of accounting for stakeholder input and staging policy implementation. Third, we highlight the need to consider system-wide consequences of implementing bundled payment policies. Fourth, we suggest how bundled payments may create research opportunities. Bundled payment policies offer opportunities and challenges. Their success will be determined not only by impacts on cost containment, but also to the extent they encourage high quality care.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Cost Control","Delivery of Health Care","Humans","Kidney Failure, Chronic","Medicare","Prospective Payment System","Reimbursement Mechanisms","Renal Dialysis","United States"]},"pmid":"23419419","title":"What can we learn from the U.S. expanded end-stage renal disease bundle?","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Drug selection decisions for state Medicaid reimbursement programs should be based on the best available evidence and free of conflicts of interest (COIs), but little is known about how the committees identify and manage COIs of the members. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the content of Medicaid drug selection committees' COI policies for the US states and the District of Colombia, (2) categorize the policies by strength, and (3) identify characteristics of a strong policy. METHODS: For all states with Medicaid Preferred Drug Lists (47 states and the District of Columbia), we conducted a systematic search of official Medicaid websites and contacted Medicaid staff by e-mail and/or telephone to identify drug selection committee COI policies. We conducted a content analysis of the policies, extracting data on COI disclosure parameters, management strategies, and review processes using predefined categories modified through an iterative process. RESULTS: Policy documents were obtained for 27 of the programs (56%)-14 from websites and 13 by contacting Medicaid officials. We found high variability in COI policies, lack of public availability, and inconsistent enforcement and management of COI among states. The most common management strategy was disclosure of COI in 67% of policies (18 of 27), followed by self-recusal in 52% of policies (14 of 27). Only 15% of policies (4 of 27) ban certain relationships with industry. CONCLUSIONS: Current policies are not transparent and not standardized, and no state policy included all model components. Wide variations suggest that some policies may not adequately protect drug selection decisions against COI and industry influence. With expected growth of Medicaid due to health care reform, the selection of drugs for Medicaid patients should be protected from the influence of COI.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"JAMA

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: National attention has focused on whether urology-radiation oncology practice integration, known as integrated prostate cancer centers, contributes to the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy, a common and expensive prostate cancer treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined prostate cancer treatment patterns before and after conversion of a urology practice to an integrated prostate cancer center in July 2006. Using the SEER (Statistics, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database, we identified patients 65 years old or older in 1 statewide registry diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2004 and 2007. We classified patients into 3 groups, including 1--those seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians (exposure group), 2--those living in the same hospital referral region who were not seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians (hospital referral region control group) and 3--those living elsewhere in the state (state control group). We compared changes in treatment among the 3 groups, adjusting for patient, clinical and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Compared with the 8.1 ppt increase in adjusted intensity modulated radiation therapy use in the state control group, the use of this therapy increased 20.3 ppts (95% CI 13.4, 27.1) in the integrated prostate cancer center group and 19.2 ppts (95% CI 9.6, 28.9) in the hospital referral region control group. Androgen deprivation therapy, for which Medicare reimbursement decreased sharply, similarly decreased in integrated prostate cancer center and hospital referral region controls. Prostatectomy decreased significantly in the integrated prostate cancer center group. CONCLUSIONS: Coincident with the conversion of a urology group practice to an integrated prostate cancer center, we observed an increase in intensity modulated radiation therapy and a decrease in androgen deprivation therapy in patients seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians and those seen in the surrounding health care market that were not observed in the remainder of the state.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of

This is time-consuming, labour intensive and may involve interruption of clinicians. We sought to identify the availability and accuracy of data held in a national dispensing database, relative to other sources of medication history information. METHODS: For patients admitted to two acute hospitals in Ireland, a Gold Standard Pre-Admission Medication List (GSPAML) was identified and corroborated with the patient or carer. The GSPAML was compared for accuracy and availability to PAMLs from other sources, including the Health Service Executive Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme (HSE-PCRS) dispensing database. RESULTS: Some 1111 medication were assessed for 97 patients, who were median age 74 years (range 18-92 years), median four co-morbidities (range 1-9), used median 10 medications (range 3-25) and half (52%) were male. The HSE-PCRS PAML was the most accurate source compared to lists provided by the general practitioner, community pharmacist or cited in previous hospital documentation: the list agreed for 74% of the medications the patients actually used, representing complete agreement for all medications in 17% of patients. It was equally contemporaneous to other sources, but was less reliable for male than female patients, those using increasing numbers of medications and those using one or more item that was not reimbursable by the HSE. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The HSE-PCRS database is a relatively accurate, available and contemporaneous source of medication history information and could support acute hospital medication reconciliation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Adolescent","Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Cross-Sectional Studies","Databases, Factual","Female","Humans","Ireland","Male","Medical History Taking","Medical Records","Medication Reconciliation","Middle Aged","Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","Patient Admission","Retrospective Studies","Young Adult"]},"pmid":"23350784","title":"Relative accuracy and availability of an Irish National Database of dispensed medication as a source of medication history information: observational study and retrospective record analysis.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Payers are known to influence the adoption of health information technology (HIT) among hospitals. However, previous studies examining the relationship between payer mix and HIT have not focused specifically on electronic health record systems (EHRs). Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, we examine how Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, and managed care caseloads are associated with EHR adoption in hospitals. Overall, we found a weak relationship between payer mix and EHR adoption. Medicare and, separately, Medicaid volumes were not associated with EHR adoption. Furthermore, commercial insurance volume was not associated with EHR adoption; however, a hospital located in the third quartile of managed care caseloads had a decreased likelihood of EHR adoption. We did not find empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that payer generosity and other indirect mechanisms influence EHR adoption in hospitals. The direct incentives embedded in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act may have a positive influence on EHR adoption--especially for hospitals with high Medicare and/or Medicaid caseloads. However, it is still uncertain whether the available incentives will offset the barriers many hospitals face in achieving meaningful use of EHRs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of
