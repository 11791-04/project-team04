Due to their conformational flexibility they are often found to interact with a multitude of protein molecules; this one-to-many interaction which is vital for their versatile functioning involves short consensus protein sequences, which are normally detected using slow and cumbersome experimental procedures. In this work we exploit information from disorder-oriented protein interaction networks focused specifically on humans, in order to assemble, by means of overrepresentation, a set of sequence patterns that mediate the functioning of disordered proteins; hence, we are able to identify how a single protein achieves such functional promiscuity. Next, we study the sequential characteristics of the extracted patterns, which exhibit a striking preference towards a very limited subset of amino acids; specifically, residues leucine, glutamic acid, and serine are particularly frequent among the extracted patterns, and we also observe a nontrivial propensity towards alanine and glycine. Furthermore, based on the extracted patterns we set off to infer potential functional implications in order to verify our findings and potentially further extrapolate our knowledge regarding the functioning of disordered proteins. We observe that the extracted patterns are primarily involved with regulation, binding and posttranslational modifications, which constitute the most prominent functions of disordered proteins.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiovascular Diseases","uri":{"id":"D002318","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Processing, Post-Translational","uri":{"id":"D011499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","uri":{"id":"D019636","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamates","uri":{"id":"D005971","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamic Acid","uri":{"id":"D018698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, Protein","uri":{"id":"D020539","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Interaction Maps","uri":{"id":"D060066","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamates","uri":{"id":"D005971","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitalism","uri":{"id":"D014799","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pliability","uri":{"id":"D018583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glutamic Acid","uri":{"id":"D018698","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Groups","uri":{"id":"D044382","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alanine","uri":{"id":"D000409","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Glycine","uri":{"id":"D005998","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leucine","uri":{"id":"D007930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417015","title":"Sequence patterns mediating functions of disordered proteins.","year":"2015"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the synthetic water-soluble phenolic antioxidant TS-13 (sodium 3-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propyl thiosulfonate), an inducer of the redox-dependent Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling system, in experimental models of acute and chronic inflammation. METHODS: Acute local inflammation was induced by intraplantar carrageenan injection into rat hind paws, and acute systemic inflammation was modeled by intravenous zymosan injection (in rats) or LPS-induced endotoxic shock (in mice). Chronic inflammation was investigated in rat models of air pouch and collagen-induced arthritis. The effects of TS-13 treatment were estimated by changes in the intensity of inflammation (paw edema, liver infiltration, animal survival, exudation, and clinical score of arthritis) and by the effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by leukocytes from peripheral blood and inflammatory exudates. RESULTS: We found the significant increase in expression of mRNA, content of protein and activity of a well-characterized Nrf2 target enzyme glutathione S-transferase P1, as well as nuclear extract protein binding to the ARE consensus sequence in liver of mice fed with diet containing TS-13. TS-13 markedly attenuated carrageenan-induced paw edema, reduced blood granulocyte number and volume density of liver infiltrates in the systemic zymosan-induced inflammation model, and increased mice survival after lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. However, TS-13 administration did not influence cell and protein exudation into air pouches and suppressed clinical manifestation of collagen-induced polyarthritis only at early stages. Nevertheless, TS-13 inhibited the generation of ROS by leukocytes in all inflammation models. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of Keap1/Nrf2/ARE system are more prominent against acute innate-mediated inflammation than chronic immune inflammation. This narrows the potential therapeutic efficacy of ARE inducers in inflammation treatment.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 31831 araBDA operon consists of three l-arabinose catabolic genes, upstream of which the galM, araR, and araE genes are located in opposite orientation. araR encodes a LacI-type transcriptional regulator that negatively regulates the l-arabinose-inducible expression of araBDA and araE (encoding an l-arabinose transporter), through a mechanism that has yet to be identified. Here we show that the AraR protein binds in vitro to three sites: one upstream of araBDA and two upstream of araE. We verify that a 16-bp consensus palindromic sequence is essential for binding of AraR, using a series of mutations introduced upstream of araB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Moreover, the DNA-binding activity of AraR is reduced by l-arabinose. We employ quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses using various mutant strains deficient in l-arabinose utilization genes to demonstrate that the prominent upregulation of araBDA and araE within 5 min of l-arabinose supplementation is dependent on the uptake but independent of the catabolism of l-arabinose. Similar expression patterns, together with the upregulation by araR disruption without l-arabinose, are evident with the apparent galM-araR operon, although attendant changes in expression levels are much smaller than those realized with the expression of araBDA and araE. The AraR-binding site upstream of araB overlaps the -10 region of the divergent galM promoter. These observations indicate that AraR acts as a transcriptional repressor of araBDA, araE, and galM-araR and that l-arabinose acts as an intracellular negative effector of the AraR-dependent regulation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of bacteriology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carrier Proteins","uri":{"id":"D002352","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Binding","uri":{"id":"D011485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay","uri":{"id":"D024202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Corynebacterium glutamicum","uri":{"id":"D048230","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inverted Repeat Sequences","uri":{"id":"D055029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabinose","uri":{"id":"D001089","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Corynebacterium","uri":{"id":"D003352","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Operon","uri":{"id":"D009876","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arabs","uri":{"id":"D018912","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24706742","title":"The LacI-Type transcriptional regulator AraR acts as an L-arabinose-responsive repressor of L-arabinose utilization genes in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 31831.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Fungi are a large, complex group, increasingly recognized as emerging threats. Their roles as modifiers of health mandate accurate portrayals of fungal communities in humans. As an entry point into the airways and gastrointestinal tract, fungi in the mouth are relevant to several biocompartments. We have revised current practices in sequence-based taxonomy assignments and employed the improvements to address the question of the fungal genera present in the healthy human mouth. The human oral mycobiome was surveyed using massively parallel, high throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicons from saliva following robust extraction methods. Taxonomy was assigned by comparison to a curated reference dataset, followed by filtering with an empirically determined BLAST E-value match statistic (10(-42)). Nomenclature corrections further refined results by conjoining redundant names for a single fungal genus. Following these curation steps, about two-thirds of the initially identified genera were eliminated. In comparison with the one similar metagenomic study and several earlier culture-based ones, our findings change the current conception of the oral mycobiome, especially with the discovery of the high prevalence and abundance of the genus Malassezia. Previously identified as an important pathogen of the skin, and recently reported as the predominant fungal genus at the nostril and backs of the head and ear, this is the first account of Malassezia in the human mouth. Findings from this study were in good agreement with others on the existence of many consensus members of the core mycobiome, and on unique patterns for individual subjects. This research offered a cautionary note about unconditional acceptance of lengthy lists of community members produced by automated assignments, provided a roadmap for enhancing the likely biological relevance of sequence-based fungal surveys, and built the foundation for understanding the role of fungi in health and disease of the oral cavity.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Activities","uri":{"id":"D006802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Kinases","uri":{"id":"D011494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Staphylococcal Protein A","uri":{"id":"D013205","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases","uri":{"id":"D017868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscle, Skeletal","uri":{"id":"D018482","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Purinergic Agents","uri":{"id":"D058905","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adenosine Triphosphate","uri":{"id":"D000255","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrolysis","uri":{"id":"D006868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incubators","uri":{"id":"D007185","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Membranes","uri":{"id":"D008566","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphotransferases","uri":{"id":"D010770","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Kinases","uri":{"id":"D011494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Purines","uri":{"id":"D011687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Suramin","uri":{"id":"D013498","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uridine Diphosphate","uri":{"id":"D014530","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uridine Triphosphate","uri":{"id":"D014544","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"24614173","title":"Redefining the human oral mycobiome with improved practices in amplicon-based taxonomy: discovery of Malassezia as a prominent commensal.","year":"2014"}

We now report the identification by whole exome sequencing of the missense mutation changing proline 47 into threonine in the first WW domain of the WW domain containing oxidoreductase gene, WWOX, located in the linkage interval. Proline 47 is a highly conserved residue that is part of the WW motif consensus sequence and is part of the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the WW fold. We demonstrate that proline 47 is a key amino acid essential for maintaining the WWOX protein fully functional, with its mutation into a threonine resulting in a loss of peptide interaction for the first WW domain. We also identified another highly conserved homozygous WWOX mutation changing glycine 372 to arginine in a second consanguineous family. The phenotype closely resembled the index family, presenting with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy, mental retardation and ataxia, but also included prominent upper motor neuron disease. Moreover, we observed that the short-lived Wwox knock-out mouse display spontaneous and audiogenic seizures, a phenotype previously observed in the spontaneous Wwox mutant rat presenting with ataxia

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Dengue is an arthropod-borne emerging viral disease with high morbidity and mortality risk in tropical countries like Brazil. Clinical manifestations are vast, ranging from asymptomatic to most severe forms of dengue such as shock. Previous data have shown that host genetics play a role in disease susceptibility and severity. Herein, we have tested the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TNF, IL10, MIF, DCSIGN, CLEC5A, NOD2, CCR5 and MRC1 as candidate genes using a matched case-control study design including 88 severe children cases of dengue patients and 335 healthy unrelated subjects that was also separated in IgG(+) and IgG(-) controls. We demonstrated that the TT genotype of CLEC5A SNP (rs1285933 C>T) is associated with dengue severity (OR=2.25; p=0.03) and that GG genotype of -336G>A DCSIGN (CD209) SNP is associated with protection to severe dengue (OR=0.12; p=0.04). Both comparisons were borderline significant when cases were compared with IgG(+) controls subgroup. Nevertheless, genotype-phenotype correlation was also assessed using serum levels of TNF from infected patients at the onset of dengue fever, and CT/TT carriers in CLEC5A secreted higher levels of TNF than CC individuals in 5-7 days of infection. No significant difference was observed in TNF levels between genotypes GG versus AG/AA at DCSIGN promoter. Next, we performed a meta-analysis retrieving results from the literature for -336G>A DCSIGN and -308G>A TNF SNPs demonstrating that the consensus estimates of these SNPs indicated no association with dengue severity (when compared to Dengue fever) in the overall analysis. But, a subgroup analysis in the -336G>A DCSIGN, the G allele was associated with severe dengue susceptibility in Asians (ORallele=2.77; p=0.0001; ORcarriers=2.99; p=0.0001) and protection in Brazilians (ORallele=0.66; p=0.013). In summary, our results suggest that genetic variations at CLEC5A increase the risk and regulate TNF secretion in dengue severity among Brazilians. Also, combined data of the literature suggest population-specific effect of the -336 DCSIGN SNP more prominent in Asians and in a different direction than Brazilians.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Much like the host cells they infect, viruses must also regulate their life cycles. Herpes simples virus type 1 (HSV-1), a prominent human pathogen, uses a promoter-rich genome in conjunction with multiple viral trans-activating factors. Following entry into host cells, the virion-associated outer tegument proteins pUL46 and pUL47 act to increase expression of viral immediate-early (α) genes, thereby helping initiate the infection life cycle. Because pUL46 has gone largely unstudied, we employed a hybrid mass spectrometry-based approach to determine how pUL46 exerts its functions during early stages of infection. For a spatio-temporal characterization of pUL46, time-lapse microscopy was performed in live cells to define its dynamic localization from 2 to 24 h postinfection. Next, pUL46-containing protein complexes were immunoaffinity purified during infection of human fibroblasts and analyzed by mass spectrometry to investigate virus-virus and virus-host interactions, as well as post-translational modifications. We demonstrated that pUL46 is heavily phosphorylated in at least 23 sites. One phosphorylation site matched the consensus 14-3-3 phospho-binding motif, consistent with our identification of 14-3-3 proteins and host and viral kinases as specific pUL46 interactions. Moreover, we determined that pUL46 specifically interacts with the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0. We demonstrated that pUL46 is partially degraded in a proteasome-mediated manner during infection, and that the catalytic activity of ICP0 is responsible for this degradation. This is the first evidence of a viral protein being targeted for degradation by another viral protein during HSV-1 infection. Together, these data indicate that pUL46 levels are tightly controlled and important for the temporal regulation of viral gene expression throughout the virus life cycle. The concept of a structural virion protein, pUL46, performing nonstructural roles is likely to reflect a theme common to many viruses, and a better understanding of these functions will be important for developing therapeutics.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular & cellular proteomics :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Twenty-nine from 52 missense mutations in apoA-I gene are predicted to be deleterious by both SIFT and PolyPhen-2 algorithms. Among those, eight mutations with a prominent change in structure stability as modeled by the SDM tool for both lipid-free (Mei and Atkinson (2011) PDB ID: 3R2P) and HDL-bound (Wu et al. (2009) PDB ID: 3K2S) apoA-I, are referred as structural. The remaining mutations with a preferential location in a long intrinsically disordered region, predicted by the SPINE-D and DNdisorder tools, may influence the functional sites. Among structural mutations, five amyloidosis-only-related mutations, significant in a lipid-free structure, are located in 1-90 region. Six amyloidosis- and hypoalphalipoproteinemia-associated mutations, differently significant in two chains of lipid-bound apoA-I, are distributed among the N-domain. Six cholesterol recognition putative motifs (5 CRAC/1 CCM) in apoA-I structure are suggested to interact with cholesterol. Among those, the K40-W50 partially conserved CCM sequence with a putative recognition feature, predicted by the MoRF tool, may underlie cholesterol binding to lipid-free apoA-I, the binding triggering the disorder-to-order transition within MoRF. Thus, the impairment of helix formation and accelerated protein aggregation may underlie the amyloidogenic effect of W50R substitution. Also, D102H substitution in conserved CRAC2 V97-K106 sequence may be harmful in reverse cholesterol transport. With PDBe Motifs and Sites algorithm, cholesterol is a ligand for L101, F104 and W108 residues in HDL-bound apoA-I. The influence of specific mutation on apoA-I structure and mutated apolipoprotein switch between different pathologies is suggested to depend on the surrounding phase properties.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biochimica et biophysica

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Despite the prominent roles played by R2R3-MYB transcription factors in the regulation of plant gene expression, little is known about the details of how these proteins interact with their DNA targets. For example, while Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYB protein AtMYB61 is known to alter transcript abundance of a specific set of target genes, little is known about the specific DNA sequences to which AtMYB61 binds. To address this gap in knowledge, DNA sequences bound by AtMYB61 were identified using cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing). The DNA targets identified using this approach corresponded to AC elements, sequences enriched in adenosine and cytosine nucleotides. The preferred target sequence that bound with the greatest affinity to AtMYB61 recombinant protein was ACCTAC, the AC-I element. Mutational analyses based on the AC-I element showed that ACC nucleotides in the AC-I element served as the core recognition motif, critical for AtMYB61 binding. Molecular modelling predicted interactions between AtMYB61 amino acid residues and corresponding nucleotides in the DNA targets. The affinity between AtMYB61 and specific target DNA sequences did not correlate with AtMYB61-driven transcriptional activation with each of the target sequences. CASTing-selected motifs were found in the regulatory regions of genes previously shown to be regulated by AtMYB61. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AtMYB61 regulates transcription from specific cis-acting AC elements in vivo. The results shed light on the specifics of DNA binding by an important family of plant-specific transcriptional regulators.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis Proteins","Base Sequence","Binding Sites","Consensus Sequence","DNA","Models, Molecular","Nucleic Acid Conformation","Nucleotide Motifs","Position-Specific Scoring Matrices","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Protein Binding","Protein Conformation","Sequence Alignment","Transcription Factors","Transcriptional Activation"]},"pmid":"23741471","title":"Interactions between the R2R3-MYB transcription factor, AtMYB61, and target DNA binding sites.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"L1 retrotransposons have a prominent role in reshaping mammalian genomes. To replicate, the L1 ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) first uses its endonuclease (EN) to nick the genomic DNA. The newly generated DNA end is subsequently used as a primer to initiate reverse transcription within the L1 RNA poly(A) tail, a process known as target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Prior studies demonstrated that most L1 insertions occur into sequences related to the L1 EN consensus sequence (degenerate 5'-TTTT/A-3' sites) and frequently preceded by imperfect T-tracts. However, it is currently unclear whether--and to which degree--the liberated 3'-hydroxyl extremity on the genomic DNA needs to be accessible and complementary to the poly(A) tail of the L1 RNA for efficient priming of reverse transcription. Here, we employed a direct assay for the initiation of L1 reverse transcription to define the molecular rules that guide this process. First, efficient priming is detected with as few as 4 matching nucleotides at the primer 3' end. Second, L1 RNP can tolerate terminal mismatches if they are compensated within the 10 last bases of the primer by an increased number of matching nucleotides. All terminal mismatches are not equally detrimental to DNA extension, a C being extended at higher levels than an A or a G. Third, efficient priming in the context of duplex DNA requires a 3' overhang. This suggests the possible existence of additional DNA processing steps, which generate a single-stranded 3' end to allow L1 reverse transcription. Based on these data we propose that the specificity of L1 reverse transcription initiation contributes, together with the specificity of the initial EN cleavage, to the distribution of new L1 insertions within the human genome.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PLoS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Resetting differentiated cells to a pluripotent state is now a widely applied technology and a key step towards personalized cell replacement therapies. Conventionally, combinations of transcription factor proteins are introduced into a differentiated cell to convert gene expression programs and to change cell fates. Yet, the molecular mechanism of nuclear reprogramming is only superficially understood. Specifically, it is unclear what sets pluripotency reprogramming factors (PRFs) molecularly apart from other transcription factor molecules that induce, for example, lineage commitment in embryonic development. Ultimately, PRFs must scan the genome of a differentiated cell, target enhancers of pluripotency factors and initiate gene expression. This requires biochemical properties to selectively recognize DNA sequences, either alone or by cooperating with other PRFs. In this review, we will discuss the molecular make-up of the prominent PRFs Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, Esrrb, Nr5a2 and Nanog and attempt to identify unique features distinguishing them from highly homologous yet functionally contrasting family members. Except for Klf4, the consensus DNA binding motifs are highly conserved for PRFs when compared to non-pluripotency inducing family members, suggesting that the individual DNA sequence preference may not be the distinguishing factor. By contrast, variant composite DNA motifs were found in pluripotency enhancers that lead to a differential assembly of various Sox and Oct family members due selective protein-protein interaction platform. As a consequence, the cooperation of PRFs on distinctly configured DNA motifs may underlie the reprogramming process. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that Sox17 can be rationally engineered into a PRF by modulating its cooperation with Oct4. An in deep understanding of this phenomenon would allow rational engineering and optimization of PRFs. This way, the reprogramming efficiency can be enhanced and fine-tuned to generate optimal synthetic reagents for regenerative medicine.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) represents the 1 chronic neuromuscular disease with the most prominent sleep disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep apneas, periodic leg movements during sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep dysregulation. The large majority of DM1 patients complain about EDS, which may have a deleterious impact on work, domestic responsibilities, social life, and quality of life. Here, we review the extant literature and report that studies are largely supportive of the view that DM1-related EDS is primarily caused by a central dysfunction of sleep regulation rather than by sleep-related disordered breathing (SRDB) or sleep fragmentation. The pathogenesis of EDS in DM1 still remains unclear but several arguments favor a model in which brain/brainstem nuclear accumulations of toxic expanded DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene are responsible for aberrant genes expression in modifying alternative splicing. Regarding management, early recognition, and treatment of SRDB with nocturnal noninvasive mechanical ventilation is first mandatory. However, despite its appropriate management, EDS often persists and may require a psychostimulant but no consensus has been yet established. Further studies are needed to clarify the discrepancies between daytime sleepiness/fatigue complaints and subjective/objective measurement of daytime sleepiness, the role of cognitive impairment and apathy in this relationship, and its reversibility with appropriate management.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current neurology and neuroscience reports","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Age of Onset","Alternative Splicing","Benzhydryl Compounds","Brain Chemistry","Brain Stem","Combined Modality Therapy","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","Disorders of Excessive Somnolence","Fatigue","Humans","Myotonic Dystrophy","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Prevalence","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Quality of Life","Severity of Illness Index","Sleep Apnea Syndromes","Sleep, REM","Social Behavior","Trinucleotide Repeats"]},"pmid":"23430686","title":"Daytime sleepiness and myotonic dystrophy.","year":"2013"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. To elucidate the mechanism underlying Gfi1b function, potential downstream transcriptional targets were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling approaches. The combination of these approaches revealed the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in the closely related megakaryocyte lineage. Accordingly, Meis1 was significantly upregulated in LSD1 inhibited erythroid cells, but not in megakaryocytes. This lineage specific upregulation in Meis1 expression was accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone3 lysine4 levels in the Meis1 promoter in LSD1 inhibited, erythroid cells. Meis1 was also substantially upregulated in gfi1b-/- fetal liver cells along with its transcriptional partners Pbx1 and several Hox messages. Elevated Meis1 message levels persisted in gfi1b mutant fetal liver cells differentiated along the erythroid lineage, relative to wild type. However, cells differentiated along the megakaryocytic lineage, exhibited no difference in Meis1 levels between controls and mutants. Transfection experiments further demonstrated specific repression of meis1 promoter driven reporters by wild type Gfi1b but neither by a SNAG domain mutant nor by a DNA binding deficient one, thus confirming direct functional regulation of this promoter by the Gfi1b transcriptional complex. Overall, our results demonstrate direct yet differential regulation of meis1 transcription by Gfi1b in distinct hematopoietic lineages thus revealing it to be a common, albeit lineage specific, target of both Gfi1b and its paralog Gfi1.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS

Mitochondria play a key role in CR adaptation; however, the molecular details remain elusive. We developed and applied a quantitative mass spectrometry method to probe the liver mitochondrial acetyl-proteome during CR versus control diet in mice that were wild-type or lacked the protein deacetylase SIRT3. Quantification of 3,285 acetylation sites-2,193 from mitochondrial proteins-rendered a comprehensive atlas of the acetyl-proteome and enabled global site-specific, relative acetyl occupancy measurements between all four experimental conditions. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses provided additional support for the effects of specific acetylation on mitochondrial protein function. Our results (1) reveal widespread reprogramming of mitochondrial protein acetylation in response to CR and SIRT3, (2) identify three biochemically distinct classes of acetylation sites, and (3) provide evidence that SIRT3 is a prominent regulator in CR adaptation by coordinately deacetylating proteins involved in diverse pathways of metabolism and mitochondrial maintenance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents, and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). A tripeptide sequence consisting of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3 and αvβ6. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Integrin αvβ6 plays an important role in the development of epithelial cells and is nearly undetectable on adult normal tissues. However, the levels of αvβ6 integrin can be upregulated during tissue remodeling and wound healing (11). On the other hand, αvβ6 integrin is strongly expressed on tumor cells of the oral cavity, pancreas, breast, ovary, colon, and stomach (12-14). αvβ6 integrin affects tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis (13). αvβ6 binds to the RGD motif in fibronectin, tenascin, and the viral protein 1 (VP1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (15). FMDV binds to cells through the RGD motif of the GH loop of the VP1.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions form the core of several biological processes. With protein-protein interfaces being considered as drug targets, studies on their interactions and molecular mechanisms are gaining ground. As the number of protein complexes in databases is scarce as compared to a spectrum of independent protein molecules, computational approaches are being considered for speedier model derivation and assessment of a plausible complex. In this study, a good approach towards in silico generation of protein-protein heterocomplex and identification of the most probable complex among thousands of complexes thus generated is documented. This approach becomes even more useful in the event of little or no binding site information between the interacting protein molecules. FINDINGS: A plausible protein-protein hetero-complex was fished out from 10 docked complexes which are a representative set of complexes obtained after clustering of 2000 generated complexes using protein-protein docking softwares. The interfacial area for this complex was predicted by two \"hotspot\" prediction programs employing different algorithms. Further, this complex had the lowest energy and most buried surface area of all the complexes with the same interfacial residues. CONCLUSIONS: For the generation of a plausible protein heterocomplex, various software tools were employed. Prominent are the protein-protein docking methods, prediction of 'hotspots' which are the amino acid residues likely to be in an interface and measurement of buried surface area of the complexes. Consensus generated in their predictions lends credence to the use of the various softwares used.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC research

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein aggrecan is the major protein constituent of cartilage aside from collagen, and is largely responsible for its distinctive mechanical properties. Aggrecan is required both for proper cartilage formation in development and maintenance of mature cartilage. Prominent ACAN transcription is a conserved feature of vertebrate cartilage, although little is known about its specific transcriptional regulation. We examined the genomic interval containing human ACAN for transcriptional enhancers directing expression to cartilage, using a functional assay in transgenic zebrafish. We tested 24 conserved non-coding sequences, representing ~6% of the total sequence in the interval, and identified eleven independently capable of regulating reporter gene expression in cartilage. These enhancers were widely spaced, from >100kb upstream of the gene to within the first intron. While the majority displayed broad cartilage expression in zebrafish larvae, several were restricted to a subset of cartilage cells in the craniofacial skeleton. In older fish, the enhancers displayed differential activity; some maintained expression, either in all cartilage or preferentially in articular cartilage at the joints, while others were not active. This remarkable degree of overlapping regulatory control has been highly conserved; we identified clear orthologues of six enhancers at the chicken ACAN locus, arranged in the same order relative to the gene. These were also functional in directing expression to cartilage in transgenic zebrafish. Several enhancers contain potential binding sites for Sox9, consistent with its described role as an upstream regulator of ACAN expression. However, others lacked Sox9 consensus binding sites, implicating additional pathways and transcription factors as regulators of ACAN expression in cartilage, either in development or adult tissue. Our identification of these enhancer sequences is the necessary first step in detailed examination of the upstream regulators of ACAN expression.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Matrix biology :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with Entamoeba histolytica. The dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were also tested. The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of ERIC-PCR bands in the control healthy rabbit was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i. were above 95 % with Sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, Erwinia amylovora and Salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 % with Xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp., Shigella flexneri, S. meliloti enterobacterial, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and Escherichia coli. The prominent bacteria had changed after E. histolytica infection. The DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with E. histolytica.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Parasitology

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women in the USA. The efficacy of existing anticancer therapeutics can be improved by targeting them through conjugation with ligands binding to cellular receptors. Recently, we developed a novel drug targeting strategy based on the use of pre-selected cancer-specific 'fusion pVIII proteins' (fpVIII), as targeting ligands. To study the efficiency of this approach in animal models, we developed a panel of breast cancer cell-binding phages as a source of targeted fpVIIIs. Two landscape phage peptide libraries (8-mer f8/8 and 9-mer f8/9) were screened to isolate 132 phage variants that recognize breast carcinoma cells MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 and internalize into the cells. When tested for their interaction with the breast cancer cells in comparison with liver cancer cells HepG2, human mammary cells MCF-10A cells and serum, 16 of the phage probes selectively interacted with the breast cancer cells whereas 32 bound both breast and liver cancer cells. The most prominent cancer-specific phage DMPGTVLP, demonstrating sub-nanomolar Kd in interaction with target cells, was used for affinity chromatography of cellular membrane molecules to reveal its potential binding receptor. The isolated protein was identified by direct sequencing as cellular surface nucleolin. This conclusion was confirmed by inhibition of the phage-cell interaction with nucleolin antibodies. Other prominent phage binders VPTDTDYS, VEEGGYIAA, and DWRGDSMDS demonstrate consensus motifs common to previously identified cancer-specific peptides. Isolated phage proteins exhibit inherent binding specificity towards cancer cells, demonstrating the functional activity of the selected fused peptides. The selected phages, their peptide inserts and intact fusion proteins can serve as promising ligands for the development of targeted nanomedicines and their study in model mice with xenograft of human cells MCF-7 and ZR-75-1.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Protein engineering, design & selection :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Yeast sulfur metabolism is transcriptionally regulated by the activator Met4. Met4 lacks DNA-binding ability and relies on interactions with Met31 and Met32, paralogous proteins that bind the same cis-regulatory element, to activate its targets. Although Met31 and Met32 are redundant for growth in the absence of methionine, studies indicate that Met32 has a prominent role over Met31 when Met30, a negative regulator of Met4 and Met32, is inactive. To characterize different roles of Met31 and Met32 in coordinating Met4-activated transcription, we examined transcription in strains lacking either Met31 or Met32 upon Met4 induction in the absence of Met30. Microarray analysis revealed that transcripts involved in sulfate assimilation and sulfonate metabolism were dramatically decreased in met32Δ cells compared to its wild-type and met31Δ counterparts. Despite this difference, both met31Δ and met32Δ cells used inorganic sulfur compounds and sulfonates as sole sulfur sources in minimal media when Met30 was present. This discrepancy may be explained by differential binding of Met31 to Cbf1-dependent promoters between these two conditions. In the absence of Met30, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses found that Met32 bound all Met4-bound targets, supporting Met32 as the main platform for Met4 recruitment. Finally, Met31 and Met32 levels were differentially regulated, with Met32 levels mimicking the profile for active Met4. These different properties of Met32 likely contribute to its prominent role in Met4-activated transcription when Met30 is absent.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular biology of the

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the most dreadful long-term complication in patients with ulcerative colitis. The incidence rate of colorectal cancer ranks second among the malignancies all over the world, and the number is still rising. Amid the many risk factors for colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis is becoming increasingly prominent. The risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis patients is estimated to be as high as 40%. There is now a consensus that patients with long-lasting ulcerative colitis (>10 years) carries an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer. Taking into account evidence from the current studies, the longer ulcerative colitis lasts, the higher risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer occurs. Unlike sporadic colorectal cancer, colitis-associated colorectal cancer usually derives from focal or multifocal dysplastic mucosa in areas of inflammation through an inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. The prognosis of colorectal cancer is poorer in patients with ulcerative colitis than those without. Therefore the presence of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis patients is a critical indication of cancer that we should watch out for. Thus, early detection and resection of precursor lesions, mainly dysplasia, to terminate the cancerous progression is of great importance. To date, chemoprophylaxis, colonoscopy surveillance and proctocolectomy have been encouraged to prevent and manage dysplastic lesions in ulcerative colitis. This article attempts to give an overview of current research of dysplasia and prevention/management of dysplasia and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms, Second Primary","uri":{"id":"D016609","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colitis, Ulcerative","uri":{"id":"D003093","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amides","uri":{"id":"D000577","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amiloride","uri":{"id":"D000584","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colitis","uri":{"id":"D003092","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colonoscopy","uri":{"id":"D003113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inflammation","uri":{"id":"D007249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mucous Membrane","uri":{"id":"D009092","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ulcer","uri":{"id":"D014456","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemoprevention","uri":{"id":"D018890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colitis, Ulcerative","uri":{"id":"D003093","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyperplasia","uri":{"id":"D006965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Colitis, Ulcerative","Colorectal Neoplasms","Humans","Hyperplasia","Risk Factors"]},"pmid":"22292619","title":"Should we sound the alarm?

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"It is generally believed that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a critical role in limiting the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and in determining the outcome of the infection, and this effect may partly depend on which HIV product is preferentially targeted. To address the correlation between HIV-1-specific CTL responses and virus replication in a cohort of former plasma donors (FPDs), 143 antiretroviral therapy naive FPDs infected with HIV-1 clade B' strains were assessed for HIV-1-specific CTL responses with an IFN-γ Elispot assay at single peptide level by using overlapping peptides (OLPs) covering the whole consensus clade B proteome. By using a Spearman's rank correlation analysis, we found that the proportion of Gag-specific CTL responses among the total virus-specific CTL activity was inversely correlated with viral loads while being positively correlated to CD4 counts, as opposed to Pol- and Env-specific responses that were associated with increased viral loads and decreased CD4 counts. In addition, Vpr-specifc CTL responses showed a similar protective effect with Gag responses, but with a much lower frequency of recognition. Significantly, we also observed an association between HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype and lower viral loads that was probably due to restricted Gag-specific CTL responses. Thus, our data demonstrate the prominent role of Gag-specific CTL responses in disease control. The advantage of HLA-A*30/B*13/Cw*06 haplotype in viral control may be associated with the contribution of Gag-specific CTL responses in the studied individuals.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cell

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether proton density-weighted imaging can detect the \"hot cross bun\" sign in the pons in multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar ataxia significantly better than T2-weighted imaging at 3T. METHODS: Sixteen consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with predominant cerebellar ataxia according to the Consensus Criteria were reviewed. Axial unenhanced proton density-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging were obtained using a dual-echo fast spin-echo sequence at 3T. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated visualisation of the abnormal pontine signal using a 4-point visual grade from Grade 0 (no \"hot cross bun\" sign) to Grade 3 (prominent \"hot cross bun\" sign on two or more sequential slices). Differences in grade between proton density-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: In 11 patients (69%), a higher grade was given for proton density-weighted imaging than T2-weighted imaging. In 1 patient (6%), grades were the same (Grade 3) on both images. In the remaining 4 patients (25%), signal abnormalities were not detected on either image (Grade 0). The \"hot cross bun\" sign was thus observed significantly better on proton density-weighted imaging than on T2-weighted imaging (P=0.001).

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation during breast cancer is one of the most difficult problems among oncologists because this regulation is likely comprised of complex genetic interactions. Given this complexity, a computational study using the Bayesian network technique has been employed to construct a gene regulatory network from microarray data. Although the Bayesian network has been notified as a prominent method to infer gene regulatory processes, learning the Bayesian network structure is NP hard and computationally intricate. Therefore, we propose a novel inference method based on low-order conditional independence that extends to the case of the Bayesian network to deal with a large number of genes and an insufficient sample size. This method has been evaluated and compared with full-order conditional independence and different prognostic indices on a publicly available breast cancer data set. Our results suggest that the low-order conditional independence method will be able to handle a large number of genes in a small sample size with the least mean square error. In addition, this proposed method performs significantly better than other methods, including the full-order conditional independence and the St. Gallen consensus criteria. The proposed method achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.79203, whereas the full-order conditional independence and the St. Gallen consensus criteria obtained 0.76438 and 0.73810, respectively. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation using the low-order conditional independence method has demonstrated a promising relationship between six gene regulators and two regulated genes and will be further investigated as potential breast cancer metastasis prognostic markers.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of biomedical informatics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Regulatory Networks","uri":{"id":"D053263","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pseudogenes","uri":{"id":"D011544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Least-Squares Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016018","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"ROC Curve","uri":{"id":"D012372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sample Size","uri":{"id":"D018401","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Regulatory Networks","uri":{"id":"D053263","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hardness","uri":{"id":"D006244","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Learning","uri":{"id":"D007858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"ROC Curve","uri":{"id":"D012372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bayes Theorem","uri":{"id":"D001499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"ROC Curve","uri":{"id":"D012372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Profiling","uri":{"id":"D020869","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D008957","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Regulatory Networks","uri":{"id":"D053263","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Bayes Theorem","Breast Neoplasms","Female","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Regulatory Networks","Humans","Models, Genetic","Neoplasm Metastasis","ROC Curve"]},"pmid":"22179053","title":"The inference of breast cancer metastasis through gene regulatory networks.","year":"2012"}

We characterize the 5' and 3' splice sites (ss) by position weight matrix scores (PWMSs), which is the highest for the consensus sequence and the lowest for splice sites differing most from the consensus sequence and used PWMS as a proxy for splicing strength. HAC1, which is known to be spliced by a nonspliceosomal mechanism, has the most negative PWMS for both its 5' ss and 3' ss. Several genes under strong splicing regulation and requiring additional splicing factors for their splicing also have small or negative PWMS values. Splicing strength is higher for highly transcribed ICGs than for lowly transcribed ICGs and higher for transcripts that bind strongly to spliceosomes than those that bind weakly. The 3' splice site features a prominent poly-U tract before the 3'AG. Our results suggest the potential of using PWMS as a screening tool for ICGs that are either spliced by a nonspliceosome mechanism or under strong splicing regulation in yeast and other fungal species.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Comparative and functional genomics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae","uri":{"id":"D012441","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomycetales","uri":{"id":"D004718","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splice Sites","uri":{"id":"D022821","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Position-Specific Scoring Matrices","uri":{"id":"D056510","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Saccharomyces","uri":{"id":"D012440","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proxy","uri":{"id":"D019727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Yeasts","uri":{"id":"D015003","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spliceosomes","uri":{"id":"D017381","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"22162666","title":"Factors affecting splicing strength of yeast genes.","year":"2011"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Tandem mass spectra of peptide ions, acquired in shotgun proteomic studies of selected proteins, tissues, and organisms, commonly include prominent peaks that cannot be assigned to the known fragmentation product ions (y, b, a, neutral losses). In many cases these persist even when creating consensus spectra for inclusion in spectral libraries, where it is important to determine whether these peaks represent new fragmentation paths or arise from impurities. Using spectra from libraries and synthesized peptides, we investigate a class of fragment ions corresponding to y(n-1) + 10 and y(n-1) + 11, where n is the number of amino acid residues in the peptide. These 10 and 11 Da differences in mass of the y ion were ascribed before to the masses of [+ CO - H(2)O] and [+ CO - NH(3)], respectively. The mechanism is suggested to involve dissociation of the N-terminal residue at the CH-CO bond following loss of H(2)O or NH(3). MS(3) spectra of these ions show that the location of the additional 10 or 11 Da is at the N-terminal residue. The y(n-1) + 10 ion is most often found in peptides with N-terminal proline, asparagine, and histidine, and also with serine and threonine in the adjacent position. The y(n-1) + 11 ion is observed predominantly with histidine and asparagine at the N-terminus, but also occurs with asparagine in positions two through four. The intensities of the y(n-1) + 10 ions decrease with increasing peptide length. These data for y(n-1) + 10 and y(n-1) + 11 ion formation may be used to improve peptide identification from tandem mass spectra.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ions","uri":{"id":"D007477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Libraries","uri":{"id":"D007990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Threonine","uri":{"id":"D013912","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteome","uri":{"id":"D020543","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteomics","uri":{"id":"D040901","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asparagine","uri":{"id":"D001216","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dissociative Disorders","uri":{"id":"D004213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Firearms","uri":{"id":"D005389","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histidine","uri":{"id":"D006639","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proline","uri":{"id":"D011392","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serine","uri":{"id":"D012694","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acid Sequence","uri":{"id":"D000595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ions","uri":{"id":"D007477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Sequence Data","uri":{"id":"D008969","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization","uri":{"id":"D021241","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteomics","uri":{"id":"D040901","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tandem Mass Spectrometry","uri":{"id":"D053719","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acids","uri":{"id":"D000596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Databases, Protein","uri":{"id":"D030562","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Amino Acid Sequence","Amino Acids","Databases, Protein","Ions","Molecular Sequence Data","Peptides","Proteomics","Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization","Tandem Mass Spectrometry"]},"pmid":"22161574","title":"Formation of y + 10 and y + 11 ions in the collision-induced dissociation of peptide ions.","year":"2012"}

Oviductin cDNA between species is highly conserved and shares 58% to 98% similarity in the deduced amino acid sequences. Our objective in this study was to sequence the full open reading frame of the feline oviductin and to examine its expression during the estrous cycle on both mRNA and protein level. The obtained cDNA containing the full open reading frame was determined to be 1677 nucleotides coding for a deduced protein of 558 amino acids. Identities between species range from 74% (mouse) to 80% (human, baboon, and rhesus) within the N-terminal protein region. Major differences were localized in the carboxy terminal region, which corresponds to exon 11 of the gene. Feline oviductin contained one putative N-linked glycosylation site, six O-linked glycosylation sites, a potential heparin binding site, and two cholesterol recognition and/or interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) domains. Oviductin expression was analyzed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. Both approaches revealed an estrous cycle-dependent expression in the ampulla and isthmus. Quantitative PCR showed highest oviductin mRNA copy numbers in the early and late follicular stage and reduced mRNA expression during all other stages. With the exception of the early follicular stage, feline oviductin mRNA abundance was not significantly different in the oviductal segments ampulla and isthmus. A prominent immunolabeling was seen in the early and late follicular stage which disappeared after ovulation, indicating a function of the protein during sperm storage and fertilization.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Theriogenology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Real-Time

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"It is widely accepted that at least 10% of all mutations causing human inherited disease disrupt splice-site consensus sequences. In contrast to splice-site mutations, the role of auxiliary cis-acting elements such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) and exonic splicing silencers (ESS) in human inherited disease is still poorly understood. Here we use a top-down approach to determine rates of loss or gain of known human exonic splicing regulatory (ESR) sequences associated with either disease-causing mutations or putatively neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We observe significant enrichment toward loss of ESEs and gain of ESSs among inherited disease-causing variants relative to neutral polymorphisms, indicating that exon skipping may play a prominent role in aberrant gene regulation. Both computational and biochemical approaches underscore the relevance of exonic splicing enhancer loss and silencer gain in inherited disease. Additionally, we provide direct evidence that both SRp20 (SRSF3) and possibly PTB (PTBP1) are involved in the function of a splicing silencer that is created de novo by a total of 83 different inherited disease mutations in 67 different disease genes. Taken together, we find that ~25% (7154/27,681) of known mis-sense and nonsense disease-causing mutations alter functional splicing signals within exons, suggesting a much more widespread role for aberrant mRNA processing in causing human inherited disease than has hitherto been appreciated.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Genome

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Orexin receptor antagonists are being investigated as therapeutic agents for insomnia and addictive disorders. In this study the interactions between the orexin receptors (orexin 1 receptor and orexin 2 receptor), orexin peptides, and small molecule orexin antagonists were explored. To study these phenomena, a variety of mutant orexin receptors was made and tested using receptor binding and functional assays. Domains of the two orexin receptors were exchanged to show the critical ligand binding domains for orexin peptides and representative selective orexin receptor antagonists. Results from domain exchanges between the orexin receptors suggest that transmembrane domain 3 is crucially important for receptor interactions with small molecule antagonists. These data also suggest that the orexin peptides occupy a larger footprint, interacting with transmembrane domain 1, the amino terminus and transmembrane domain 5 as well as transmembrane domain 3. Transmembrane domain 3 has been shown to be an important part of the small molecule binding pocket common to rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptors. Additional orexin receptor 2 point mutations were made based on the common arrangement of receptor transmembrane domains shown in the G-protein coupled receptor crystal structure literature and the impact of orexin 2 receptor residue threonine 135 on the ligand selectivity of the 2 orexin receptors. These data support a model of the orexin receptor binding pocket in which transmembrane domains 3 and 5 are prominent contributors to ligand binding and functional activity. The data also illustrate key contact points for ligand interactions in the consensus small molecule pocket of these receptors.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of

To investigate the global role of phosphorylation in the regulation of caspase signaling, we designed a peptide match program to identify sequences from the human proteome that contained overlapping recognition motifs for caspases and kinases. We identified the protein kinase CK2 as the most prominent kinase with a consensus site for phosphorylation that overlapped with caspase recognition motifs. We then evaluated potential targets of CK2 and caspases by combining peptide array target screens with identification of caspase substrates. We identified numerous shared candidate targets of CK2 and caspases, including procaspase-3, which functions at a level at which both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signals converge. Together, these data support a role for CK2-dependent phosphorylation as a global mechanism for inhibiting caspase signaling pathways.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Science signaling","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Amino Acid Sequence","Apoptosis","Casein Kinase II","Caspases","Hydrolysis","Mass Spectrometry","Phosphorylation","Signal Transduction","Substrate Specificity"]},"pmid":"21558555","title":"A peptide-based target screen implicates the protein kinase CK2 in the global regulation of caspase signaling.","year":"2011"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Estrogen receptor (ER) binds to a spectrum of functional estrogen response elements (ERE) within the human genome, including ERE half-sites (HERE), inverted and direct repeats. This has been confounding, because ER has been reported to bind weakly, if at all, to these sites in vitro. We show that ER binds strongly to these nonconventional EREs, and the binding is enhanced by the presence of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). Collectively, these and previous findings reinforce the notion of the plasticity of strong ER/ERE interactions, consistent with their broader range of observed binding specificity. In addition, transient transfection studies using luciferase reporter gene assays show that these EREs drive luciferase activity, and HMGB1 enhances transcriptional activity. Furthermore, HMGB1 gene expression knockdown results in a precipitous drop in luciferase activity, suggesting a prominent role for HMGB1 in activation of estrogen/ER-responsive genes. Therefore, these data advocate that the minimal target site for ER is a cHERE (consensus HERE) that occurs in many different contexts and that HMGB1 enhances both the binding affinity and transcriptional activity. This challenges the current paradigm for ER binding affinity and functional activity and suggests that the paradigm requires significant reevaluation and modification. These findings also suggest a possible mechanism for a cross talk between genes regulated by ER and class II nuclear receptors.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular endocrinology

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The mammalian circadian clock uses interlocked negative feedback loops in which the heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor BMAL1/CLOCK is a master regulator. While there is prominent control of liver functions by the circadian clock, the detailed links between circadian regulators and downstream targets are poorly known. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing we obtained a time-resolved and genome-wide map of BMAL1 binding in mouse liver, which allowed us to identify over 2,000 binding sites, with peak binding narrowly centered around Zeitgeber time 6. Annotation of BMAL1 targets confirms carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the major output of the circadian clock in mouse liver. Moreover, transcription regulators are largely overrepresented, several of which also exhibit circadian activity. Genes of the core circadian oscillator stand out as strongly bound, often at promoter and distal sites. Genomic sequence analysis of the sites identified E-boxes and tandem E1-E2 consensus elements. Electromobility shift assays showed that E1-E2 sites are bound by a dimer of BMAL1/CLOCK heterodimers with a spacing-dependent cooperative interaction, a finding that was further validated in transactivation assays. BMAL1 target genes showed cyclic mRNA expression profiles with a phase distribution centered at Zeitgeber time 10. Importantly, sites with E1-E2 elements showed tighter phases both in binding and mRNA accumulation. Finally, analyzing the temporal profiles of BMAL1 binding, precursor mRNA and mature mRNA levels showed how transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation contribute differentially to circadian expression phase. Together, our analysis of a dynamic protein-DNA interactome uncovered how genes of the core circadian oscillator crosstalk and drive phase-specific circadian output programs in a complex tissue.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PLoS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Induction of tolerance against grafted organs is achieved by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine, a prominent member of the calcineurin inhibitors. Unfortunately, its lifetime use is associated with hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Several mechanism for cyclosporine induced hypertension have been proposed, i.e. activation of the sympathetic nervous system, endothelin-mediated systemic vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation secondary to reduction in prostaglandin and nitric oxide, altered cytosolic calcium translocation, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In this regard the molecular basis for undue RAS activation and an increased signaling of the vasoactive oligopeptide angiotensin II (AngII) remain elusive. Notably, angiotensinogen (AGT) is the precursor of AngII and transcriptional regulation of AGT is controlled by the hepatic nuclear factor HNF4alpha. To better understand the molecular events associated with cyclosporine induced hypertension, we investigated the effect of cyclosporine on HNF4alpha expression and activity and searched for novel HNF4alpha target genes among members of the RAS cascade. Using bioinformatic algorithm and EMSA bandshift assays we identified angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as genes targeted by HNF4alpha. Notably, cyclosporine represses HNF4alpha gene and protein expression and its DNA-binding activity at consensus sequences to AGT, AGTR1, ACE, and ACE2. Consequently, the gene expression of AGT, AGTR1, and ACE2 was significantly reduced as evidenced by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. While RAS is composed of a sophisticated interplay between multiple factors we propose a decrease of ACE2 to enforce AngII signaling via AGTR1 to ultimately result in vasoconstriction and hypertension. Taken collectively we demonstrate cyclosporine to repress HNF4alpha activity through calcineurin inhibitor mediated inhibition of nuclear factor of activation of T-cells (NFAT) which in turn represses HNF4alpha that leads to a disturbed balance of RAS.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Database searches have shown that a part of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) transcripts may originate at an alternative upstream promoter (P2) located 2.6 kb upstream of the known (P1) GBA promoter. The putative alternative transcripts contained one or two extra exons (exon -2 or exons -2, -1, respectively), but the first ATG codon and predicted amino-acid sequence are the same as in the transcript from P1. Luciferase assays confirmed promoter activity of both sites in HepG2 cells: the P1 construct exhibited the highest activity of luciferase (17.82±1.10 relative luciferase units), while the P2 construct reached 3.01±0.43 relative luciferase units. Serial 5' deletions of P2 led to changes in reporter activity, the most prominent decreases were observed in deletion constructs carrying bases -353 to -658, and -353 to -920 (numbered as in NM_001005750.1), respectively. This suggests that the P2 core promoter is contained within the region of -920bp to -1311bp. Three P2 transcription initiation sites were found by 5' RACE at positions 347, 380, and 413bp upstream of the +1 ATG. The expression stability of transcripts from P2, P1 was studied in 20 human tissues and was higher than that of GAPDH and ACTB, which are commonly used as reference housekeeping genes. The P2 contains an unmethylated CpG island, multiple Sp-1 consensus binding sites and, unlike P1, does not contain a TATA box, features all common to the majority of housekeeping gene promoters. We have examined DNA samples from a phenotypically diverse group of twenty Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher patients homozygous for the common mild mutation N370S. Both P1 and P2, as well as exons -2 and -1, did not contain any sequence variations, with the exception of the known polymorphism rs10908459 found on one allele. The phenotypical differences in the patients were thus not explained by nucleotide variations in both promoters.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Blood cells, molecules &

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"archipelago (ago)/Fbw7 encodes a conserved protein that functions as the substrate-receptor component of a polyubiquitin ligase that suppresses tissue growth in flies and tumorigenesis in vertebrates. Ago/Fbw7 targets multiple proteins for degradation, including the G1-S regulator Cyclin E and the oncoprotein dMyc/c-Myc. Despite prominent roles in growth control, little is known about the signals that regulate Ago/Fbw7 abundance in developing tissues. Here we use the Drosophila eye as a model to identify developmental signals that regulate ago expression. We find that expression of ago mRNA and protein is induced by passage of the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and identify the hedgehog (hh) and Notch (N) pathways as elements of this inductive mechanism. Cells mutant for N pathway components, or hh-defective cells that express reduced levels of the Notch ligand Delta, fail to upregulate ago transcription in the region of the MF; reciprocally, ectopic N activation in eye discs induces expression of ago mRNA. A fragment of the ago promoter that contains consensus binding sites for the N pathway transcription factor Su(H) is bound by Su(H) and confers N-inducibility in cultured cells. The failure to upregulate ago in N pathway mutant cells correlates with accumulation of the SCF-Ago target Cyclin E in the area of the MF, and this is rescued by re-expression of ago. These data suggest a model in which N acts through ago to restrict levels of the pro-mitotic factor Cyclin E. This N-Ago-Cyclin E link represents a significant new cell cycle regulatory mechanism in the developing eye.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Animals","Animals, Genetically Modified","Base Sequence","Cell Cycle","Cyclin E","DNA Primers","Drosophila Proteins","Drosophila melanogaster","Eye","F-Box Proteins","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Insect","Hedgehog Proteins","Mutation","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Protein Subunits","RNA, Messenger","Receptors, Notch","Signal Transduction","Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"]},"pmid":"21148181","title":"Notch-dependent expression of the archipelago ubiquitin ligase subunit in the Drosophila eye.","year":"2011"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Mismatch repair corrects errors that have escaped polymerase proofreading enhancing replication fidelity by at least two orders of magnitude. The β and PCNA sliding clamps increase the polymerase processivity during DNA replication and are important at several stages of mismatch repair. Both MutS and MutL, the two proteins that initiate the mismatch repair response, interact with β. Binding of MutS to β is important to recruit MutS and MutL to foci. Moreover, the endonuclease activity of human and yeast MutLα is stimulated by PCNA. However, the concrete functions of the processivity clamp in the repair steps preceding DNA resynthesis remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of MutL encompasses a bona fide β-binding motif that mediates a weak, yet specific, interaction between the two proteins. Mutation of this conserved motif correlates with defects in mismatch repair, demonstrating that the direct interaction with β is important for MutL function. The interaction between the C-terminal domain of MutL and β is conserved in both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, but the repair defects associated with mutation of this β-binding motif are more severe in the former, suggesting that this interaction may have a more prominent role in methyl-independent than methyl-directed mismatch repair systems. Together with previously published data, our work strongly suggests that β may stimulate the endonuclease activity of MutL through its direct interaction with the C-terminal domain of MutL.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"DNA

The C-stretch renders these genes capable of phase variation, through spontaneous variations in its length. For each of these we determined the length of the C-stretch that gave maximal transcriptional activity, and found that the three optimized promoters align perfectly, with identical distances between conserved upstream sequences and the downstream -10 elements and transcriptional start sites. We also demonstrated, for Pfim3, that the conserved sequence corresponds to BvgA binding sites. The more upstream of the two binding sites is predicted to be high affinity, by comparison to a functionally derived consensus BvgA-binding sequence. The other binding site is a fairly poor match to this consensus, with 10 of 14 bp belonging to the C-stretch. Interestingly, the centre of this downstream site of BvgA binding coincides exactly with the centre of the expected typical location of a -35 sequence. However, the lack of a recognizable -35 element (CCCCCC versus TTGACA), and the occupation of this site by BvgA∼P suggest that activation of the fim promoters involves unusual interactions among BvgA, RNA polymerase and promoter DNA.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents, and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). A tripeptide sequence consisting of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3 and αvβ6. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). The αvβ6 integrin plays an important role in the development of epithelial cells and is nearly undetectable in adult normal tissues. However, levels of the αvβ6 integrin can be upregulated during tissue remodeling and wound healing (11). On the other hand, αvβ6 integrin is strongly expressed on tumor cells of the oral cavity, pancreas, breast, ovary, colon, and stomach (12-14). The αvβ6 integrin affects tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis (13). αvβ6 binds to the RGD motif in fibronectin, tenascin, and the viral protein 1 (VP1) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (15). FMDV binds to cells through the RGD motif of the GH loop of the VP1. A consensus αvβ6-binding motif DLXXL was identified with phage display screening with minimal binding to αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and αvβ5 (16). A peptide of 20 amino acids, NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVART (A20FMDV2), was identified as a ligand binding to αvβ6 integrin (15). A20FMDV2 was radiolabeled with N-succinimidyl 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) to study in vivo biodistribution of the tracer in tumor-bearing mice (17). [(18)F]FB-A20FMDV2 was found to have specific accumulation in αvβ6-positive tumor.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":null,"meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Membrane

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Kininogens, the major plasma cystatin-like inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins, are degraded at sites of inflammation, and cathepsin B has been identified as a prominent mediator of this process. Cathepsin B, in contrast to cathepsins L and S, is poorly inhibited by kininogens. This led us to delineate the molecular interactions between this protease and kininogens (high molecular weight kininogen and low molecular weight kininogen) and to elucidate the dual role of the occluding loop in this weak inhibition. Cathepsin B cleaves high molecular weight kininogen within the N-terminal region of the D2 and D3 cystatin-like domains and close to the consensus QVVAG inhibitory pentapeptide of the D3 domain. The His110Ala mutant, unlike His111Ala cathepsin B, fails to hydrolyze kininogens, but rather forms a tight-binding complex as observed by gel-filtration analysis. K(i) values (picomolar range) as well as association rate constants for the His110Ala cathepsin B variant compare to those reported for cathepsin L for both kininogens. Homology modeling of isolated inhibitory (D2 and D3) domains and molecular dynamics simulations of the D2 domain complexed with wild-type cathepsin B and its mutants indicate that additional weak interactions, due to the lack of the salt bridge (Asp22-His110) and the subsequent open position of the occluding loop, increase the inhibitory potential of kininogens on His110Ala cathepsin B.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of molecular

These observations, in conjunction with a very similar situation disclosed by analyzing the phosphopeptides of the human cerebrospinal fluid collected from literature, support the view that GCK may

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Despite high levels of homology, transcription coactivators p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) are both indispensable during embryogenesis. They are largely known to regulate the same genes. To identify genes preferentially regulated by p300 or CBP, we performed an extensive genome-wide survey using the ChIP-seq on cell-cycle synchronized cells. We found that 57% of the tags were within genes or proximal promoters, with an overall preference for binding to transcription start and end sites. The heterogeneous binding patterns possibly reflect the divergent roles of CBP and p300 in transcriptional regulation. Most of the 16 103 genes were bound by both CBP and p300. However, after stimulation 89 and 1944 genes were preferentially bound by CBP or p300, respectively. Target genes were found to be primarily involved in the regulation of metabolic and developmental processes, and transcription, with CBP showing a stronger preference than p300 for genes active in negative regulation of transcription. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites suggest that CBP and p300 have many partners in common, but AP-1 and Serum Response Factor (SRF) appear to be more prominent in CBP-specific sequences, whereas AP-2 and SP1 are enriched in p300-specific targets. Taken together, our findings further elucidate the distinct roles of coactivators p300 and CBP in transcriptional regulation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nucleic acids

Using a saeR/S isogenic deletion mutant of USA300 (USA300DeltasaeR/S) in murine models of sepsis and soft-tissue infection revealed that this sensory system is critical to pathogenesis of USA300 during both superficial and invasive infection. Oligonucleotide microarray and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified numerous extracellular virulence genes that are down-regulated in USA300DeltasaeR/S. Unexpectedly, an up-regulation of mecA and mecR1 corresponded to increased methicillin resistance in USA300DeltasaeR/S. 5'-RACE analysis defined transcript start sites for sbi, efb, mecA, lukS-PV, hlb, SAUSA300_1975, and hla, to underscore a conserved consensus sequence within promoter regions of genes under strong SaeR/S transcriptional regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments illustrated direct binding of SaeR(His) to promoter regions containing the conserved consensus sequence. Collectively, the findings of this investigation demonstrate that SaeR/S directly interacts with virulence gene promoters to significantly influence USA300

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Putative transcription factors have only recently been identified in the Plasmodium spp., with the major family of regulators comprising the Apicomplexan Apetala2 (AP2) proteins. To better understand the DNA-binding mechanisms of these transcriptional regulators, we characterized the structure and in vitro function of an AP2 DNA-binding domain from a prototypical Apicomplexan AP2 protein, PF14_0633 from Plasmodium falciparum. The X-ray crystal structure of the PF14_0633 AP2 domain bound to DNA reveals a beta-sheet fold that binds the DNA major groove through base-specific and backbone contacts; a prominent alpha-helix supports the beta-sheet structure. Substitution of predicted DNA-binding residues with alanine weakened or eliminated DNA binding in solution. In contrast to plant AP2 domains, the PF14_0633 AP2 domain dimerizes upon binding to DNA through a domain-swapping mechanism in which the alpha-helices of the AP2 domains pack against the beta-sheets of the dimer mates. DNA-induced dimerization of PF14_0633 may be important for tethering two distal DNA loci together in the nucleus and/or for inducing functional rearrangements of its domains to facilitate transcriptional regulation. Consistent with a multisite binding mode, at least two copies of the consensus sequence recognized by PF14_0633 are present upstream of a previously identified group of sporozoite-stage genes. Taken together, these findings illustrate how Plasmodium has adapted the AP2 DNA-binding domain for genome-wide transcriptional regulation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Transposable elements (TEs) make up a half of the human genome, but the extent of their contribution to cryptic exon activation that results in genetic disease is unknown. Here, a comprehensive survey of 78 mutation-induced cryptic exons previously identified in 51 disease genes revealed the presence of TEs in 40 cases (51%). Most TE-containing exons were derived from short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), with Alus and mammalian interspersed repeats (MIRs) covering >18 and >16% of the exonized sequences, respectively. The majority of SINE-derived cryptic exons had splice sites at the same positions of the Alu/MIR consensus as existing SINE exons and their inclusion in the mRNA was facilitated by phylogenetically conserved changes that improved both traditional and auxiliary splicing signals, thus marking intronic TEs amenable for pathogenic exonization. The overrepresentation of MIRs among TE exons is likely to result from their high average exon inclusion levels, which reflect their strong splice sites, a lack of splicing silencers and a high density of enhancers, particularly (G)AA(G) motifs. These elements were markedly depleted in antisense Alu exons, had the most prominent position on the exon-intron gradient scale and are proposed to promote exon definition through enhanced tertiary RNA interactions involving unpaired (di)adenosines. The identification of common mechanisms by which the most dynamic parts of the genome contribute both to new exon creation and genetic disease will facilitate detection of intronic mutations and the development of computational tools that predict TE hot-spots of cryptic exon activation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Human

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Retroviral LTRs, paired or single, influence the transcription of both retroviral and non-retroviral genomic sequences. Vertebrate genomes contain many thousand endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and their LTRs. Single LTRs are difficult to detect from genomic sequences without recourse to repetitiveness or presence in a proviral structure. Understanding of LTR structure increases understanding of LTR function, and of functional genomics. Here we develop models of orthoretroviral LTRs useful for detection in genomes and for structural analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although mutated, ERV LTRs are more numerous and diverse than exogenous retroviral (XRV) LTRs. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and alignments based on them, were created for HML- (human MMTV-like), general-beta-, gamma- and lentiretroviruslike LTRs, plus a general-vertebrate LTR model. Training sets were XRV LTRs and RepBase LTR consensuses. The HML HMM was most sensitive and detected 87% of the HML LTRs in human chromosome 19 at 96% specificity. By combining all HMMs with a low cutoff, for screening, 71% of all LTRs found by RepeatMasker in chromosome 19 were found. HMM consensus sequences had a conserved modular LTR structure. Target site duplications (TG-CA), TATA (occasionally absent), an AATAAA box and a T-rich region were prominent features. Most of the conservation was located in, or adjacent to, R and U5, with evidence for stem loops. Several of the long HML LTRs contained long ORFs inserted after the second A rich module. HMM consensus alignment allowed comparison of functional features like transcriptional start sites (sense and antisense) between XRVs and ERVs. CONCLUSION: The modular conserved and redundant orthoretroviral LTR structure with three A-rich regions is reminiscent of structurally relaxed Giardia promoters. The five HMMs provided a novel broad range, repeat-independent, ab initio LTR detection, with prospects for greater generalisation, and insight into LTR structure, which may aid development of LTR-targeted pharmaceuticals.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS

We examined genome-wide BCL6 promoter binding in GC B cells versus DLBCLs to better understand its function in these settings. BCL6 bound to both distinct and common sets of functionally related gene in normal GC cells versus DLBCL cells. Certain BCL6 target genes were preferentially repressed in GC B cells, but not DLBCL cells. Several such genes have prominent oncogenic functions, such as BCL2, MYC, BMI1, EIF4E, JUNB, and CCND1. BCL6 and BCL2 expression was negatively correlated in primary DLBCLs except in the presence of BCL2 translocations. The specific BCL6 inhibitor retro-inverso BCL6 peptidomimetic inhibitor-induced expression of BCL2 and other oncogenes, consistent with direct repression effects by BCL6. These data are consistent with a model whereby BCL6 can directly silence oncogenes in GC B cells and counterbalance its own tumorigenic potential. Finally, a BCL6 consensus sequence and binding sites for other physiologically relevant transcription factors were highly enriched among target genes and distributed in a pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that BCL6 forms specific regulatory circuits with other B-cell transcriptional

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"MOTIVATION: Receptor-ligand interactions play an important role in controlling many biological systems. One prominent example is the binding of peptides to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules controlling the onset of cellular immune responses. Thousands of MHC allelic versions exist, making determination of the binding specificity for each variant experimentally infeasible. Here, we present a method that can extrapolate from variants with known binding specificity to those where no experimental data are available. RESULTS: For each position in the peptide ligand, we extracted the polymorphic pocket residues in MHC molecules that are in close proximity to the peptide residue. For MHC molecules with known specificities, we established a library of pocket-residues and corresponding binding specificities. The binding specificity for a novel MHC molecule is calculated as the average of the specificities of MHC molecules in this library weighted by the similarity of their pocket-residues to the query. This PickPocket method is demonstrated to accurately predict MHC-peptide binding for a broad range of MHC alleles, including human and non-human species. In contrast to neural network-based pan-specific methods, PickPocket was shown to be robust both when data is scarce and when the similarity to MHC molecules with characterized binding specificity is low. A consensus method combining the PickPocket and NetMHCpan methods was shown to achieve superior predictive performance. This study demonstrates how integration of diverse algorithmic approaches can lead to improved prediction. The method may also be used for making ligand-binding predictions for other types of receptors where many variants exist.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Major Histocompatibility Complex","uri":{"id":"D008285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity, Cellular","uri":{"id":"D007111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histocompatibility","uri":{"id":"D006648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Libraries","uri":{"id":"D007990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ligands","uri":{"id":"D008024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino Acid Sequence","uri":{"id":"D000595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Sequence Data","uri":{"id":"D008969","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Binding","uri":{"id":"D011485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Software","uri":{"id":"D012984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computational Biology","uri":{"id":"D019295","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Binding Sites","uri":{"id":"D001665","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histocompatibility Antigens","uri":{"id":"D006649","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Major Histocompatibility Complex","uri":{"id":"D008285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Interaction Mapping","uri":{"id":"D025941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Databases, Protein","uri":{"id":"D030562","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Amino Acid Sequence","Binding Sites","Computational Biology","Databases, Protein","Histocompatibility Antigens","Major Histocompatibility Complex","Molecular Sequence Data","Peptides","Protein Binding","Protein Interaction Mapping","Software"]},"pmid":"19297351","title":"The PickPocket method for predicting binding specificities for receptors based on receptor pocket similarities: application to MHC-peptide binding.","year":"2009"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Protein glycosylation is an important element of biologic systems because of its significant effects on protein properties and functions. Although prominent within all domains of life, O-linked glycosylation systems modifying serine and threonine residues within bacteria and eukaryotes differ substantially in target protein selectivity. In particular, well-characterized bacterial systems have been invariably dedicated to modification of individual proteins or related subsets thereof. Here we characterize a general O-linked glycosylation system that targets structurally and functionally diverse groups of membrane-associated proteins in the gram-negative bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of the human disease gonorrhea. The 11 glycoproteins identified here are implicated in activities as varied as protein folding, disulfide bond formation, and solute uptake, as well as both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Along with their common trafficking within the periplasmic compartment, the protein substrates share quasi-related domains bearing signatures of low complexity that were demonstrated to encompass sites of glycan occupancy. Thus, as in eukaryotes, the broad scope of this system is dictated by the relaxed specificity of the glycan transferase as well as the bulk properties and context of the protein-targeting signal rather than by a strict amino acid consensus sequence. Together, these findings reveal previously unrecognized commonalities linking O-linked protein glycosylation in distantly related life forms.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proceedings of the

Pulmonary disease, endothelial abnormalities and inflammation are prominent features of sickle cell disease (SCD). Butyrate has opposing effects on endogenous TNFSF15 expression in pulmonary endothelium, acting as an inhibitor in HPAEC and an inducer in HMVEC. Similar effects were observed with a known cytokine TNF-alpha in these two cell types. Furthermore the TNFSF15 promoter utilized different combinations of cis-elements for its expression in these two cell types. AP1-like and G-rich sequence elements were critical for promoter activity in large vessel HPAEC while AP1-like and NF-kappaB consensus sequence elements were required in small vessel HMVEC. The requirement of an NF-kappaB sequence element by the TNFSF15 promoter in HMVEC but not in HPAEC supported the notion that HMVEC might be a target of inflammation and vasoocclusion in SCD. The dual effects of butyrate-dependant TNFSF15 regulation in lung endothelium may help in identify inflammatory pathways and understand the role of HMVEC in pathogenesis of vasoocclusion in SCD.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cytokine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors,

Sequence analysis showed that three out of the six hot-spot amino acid residues of wtIFN-alpha8 known to be important for the interaction with the IFN-alpha receptor-2 (IFNAR-2)-binding sites were substituted to other amino acids and the others remained. Although affinity analysis revealed that the dissociation constant (K(D)) of IFN-alpha8 mutants was almost the same with that of wtIFN-alpha8, furthermore, the rates of association (k(a)) and dissociation (k(d)) were relatively lower. These results suggest that changes in the surface electronic charge of amino acid residues lead to changes in binding affinity and kinetics (prolonged dissociation time) toward the IFNAR-2, resulting in the modification of the biological activity. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the molecular engineering of the IFN-alpha8 provides important insight into action of IFN and also it would be useful in the development of therapeutically prominent IFN preparations than those used in clinical practice.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The resolution of the chicken consensus linkage map has been dramatically improved in this study by genotyping 12,945 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on three existing mapping populations in chicken: the Wageningen (WU), East Lansing (EL), and Uppsala (UPP) mapping populations. As many as 8599 SNPs could be included, bringing the total number of markers in the current consensus linkage map to 9268. The total length of the sex average map is 3228 cM, considerably smaller than previous estimates using the WU and EL populations, reflecting the higher quality of the new map. The current map consists of 34 linkage groups and covers at least 29 of the 38 autosomes. Sex-specific analysis and comparisons of the maps based on the three individual populations showed prominent heterogeneity in recombination rates between populations, but no significant heterogeneity between sexes. The recombination rates in the F(1) Red Jungle fowl/White Leghorn males and females were significantly lower compared with those in the WU broiler population, consistent with a higher recombination rate in purebred domestic animals under strong artificial selection. The recombination rate varied considerably among chromosomes as well as along individual chromosomes. An analysis of the sequence composition at recombination hot and cold spots revealed a strong positive correlation between GC-rich sequences and high recombination rates. The GC-rich cohesin binding sites in particular stood out from other GC-rich sequences with a 3.4-fold higher density at recombination hot spots versus cold spots, suggesting a functional relationship between recombination frequency and cohesin binding.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Genome

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Conformational transitions are a crucial factor in the vast majority of protein misfolding diseases. In most of these cases, the change in conformation is accompanied by the formation of insoluble aggregates, which often precludes a detailed characterization at the molecular level. Therefore, much effort has been put into the development of simplified, easy-to-synthesize peptide models that can be used to elucidate the molecular processes that underlie the conformational switch. For a design to be successful, two, sometimes concomitantly fulfilled, requirements are of importance. First, it is essential to create inherent structural ambiguity. This is usually achieved by combining the most prominent characteristics of different folds within a consensus sequence. Second, a stimulus-sensitive functionality that responds to alterations in the environment, such as pH, ionic strength or the presence of metal ions, is often needed to control structural conversion and to shift the equilibrium in either direction.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current opinion in chemical biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Osmolar Concentration","uri":{"id":"D009994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteostasis Deficiencies","uri":{"id":"D057165","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrogen-Ion Concentration","uri":{"id":"D006863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ions","uri":{"id":"D007477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Conformation","uri":{"id":"D011487","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temperature","uri":{"id":"D013696","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrogen Bonding","uri":{"id":"D006860","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metals","uri":{"id":"D008670","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Folding","uri":{"id":"D017510","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Hydrogen Bonding","Metals","Peptides","Protein Conformation","Protein Folding","Temperature"]},"pmid":"18840544","title":"Following polypeptide folding and assembly with conformational switches.","year":"2008"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Helical bundles which bind heme and porphyrin cofactors have been popular targets for cofactor-containing de novo protein design. By analyzing a highly nonredundant subset of the protein databank we have determined a rotamer distribution for helical histidines bound to heme cofactors. Analysis of the entire nonredundant database for helical sequence preferences near the ligand histidine demonstrated little preference for amino acid side chain identity, size, or charge. Analysis of the database subdivided by ligand histidine rotamer, however, reveals strong preferences in each case, and computational modeling illuminates the structural basis for some of these findings. The majority of the rotamer distribution matches that predicted by molecular simulation of a single porphyrin-bound histidine residue placed in the center of an all-alanine helix, and the deviations explain two prominent features of natural heme protein binding sites: heme distortion in the case of the cytochromes C in the m166 histidine rotamer, and a highly prevalent glycine residue in the t73 histidine rotamer. These preferences permit derivation of helical consensus sequence templates which predict optimal side chain-cofactor packing interactions for each rotamer. These findings thus promise to guide future design endeavors not only in the creation of higher affinity heme and porphyrin binding sites, but also in the direction of bound cofactor geometry.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proteins","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amino

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"We reported earlier that an interferon-inducible p204 protein serves as a cofactor of Cbfa1 and promotes osteogenesis. Here we establish that p204 demonstrates prominent expression in growth plate chondrocytes. It is differentially expressed in the course of bone morphogenetic protein-2-triggered chondrocyte differentiation of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells. This expression is probably due to the activation of p204 gene by Cbfa1 and repression by Sox5 transcription factor. Cbfa1 and Sox5 bind to the 5'-flanking regulatory region of p204 gene at their consensus binding elements. Overexpression of p204 accelerates chondrocyte hypertrophy, as revealed by enhanced expression of type X Collagen and matrix metalloproteinase-13; however, knockdown of p204 via an siRNA approach abolishes hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. p204 acts as a cofactor of Cbfa1 in chondrocyte hypertrophy: (1) overexpression of p204 augments, whereas suppression of p204 decreases, the Cbfa1-dependent transactivation of a Collagen X-specific reporter gene; (2) p204 enhances Cbfa1-mediated chondrocyte hypertrophy; and (3) p204 associates with Cbfa1 in chondrocyte differentiation. In addition, altered expression of p204 in chondrocyte hypertrophy was accompanied by altered levels of Indian hedgehog (IHH) and parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor-1 (PTHR1). Collectively, p204 is a novel regulator of chondrocyte differentiation by (1) acting as a coactivator of Cbfa1 and (2) affecting IHH/PTPrP signaling.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cell death

While the predominant dinucleotides bordering each of these types of introns and the catalytic mechanism used in their excision are conserved in plants and animals, several features aiding in the recognition of plant introns are distinct from those in animals and yeast. Along with their short length, high AU content and high variation in their 5' and 3' splice sites and branchpoint consensus sequences are the most prominent characteristics of plant introns. Detailed surveys of site-directed mutant introns tested in vivo and chemically induced and naturally mutant introns analyzed in planta emphasize the effects of changing individual nucleotides in these splice site consensus sequences and highlight a number of noncanonical dinucleotides that are functional in plant systems.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Current topics in microbiology and immunology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splice Sites","uri":{"id":"D022821","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Introns","uri":{"id":"D007438","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nucleotides","uri":{"id":"D009711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Minors","uri":{"id":"D033242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Precursors","uri":{"id":"D012322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Yeasts","uri":{"id":"D015003","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spliceosomes","uri":{"id":"D017381","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eukaryota","uri":{"id":"D056890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nuclear Proteins","uri":{"id":"D009687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plants","uri":{"id":"D010944","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exons","uri":{"id":"D005091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Introns","uri":{"id":"D007438","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plant Proteins","uri":{"id":"D010940","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Precursors","uri":{"id":"D012322","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splicing","uri":{"id":"D012326","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA Splice Sites","uri":{"id":"D022821","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Exons","Introns","Mutation","Nuclear Proteins","Plant Proteins","Plants","RNA Precursors","RNA Splice Sites","RNA Splicing"]},"pmid":"18630746","title":"Splice site requirements and switches in plants.","year":"2008"}

The HBV genomes in five asymptomatic blood donors with occult HBV infection and low viremia (<10 to 1,000 HBV DNA copies/mL, genotype D) were studied. An unusually large number of amino acid mutations was present in the immunodominant a-determinant of HBsAg (respectively 3, 6, 7, 10, and 10 mutations). Comparison of the HBV genomes in two donors to a consensus HBV genotype D sequence showed a most prominent hotspot of genetic variation in HBV nucleotides 480-570, encoding the HBsAg a-determinant. The phylogenetic comparison of separate donor HBV genes to the HBV genes of 11 reference strains (genotypes A-H) showed the donor HBV surface genes to form an outgroup, while the HBV polymerase, core and X genes closely cluster with the HBV genotype D reference strain. Maybe the HBV strains in this study represent a natural end-stage of seemingly cleared HBV infection, in which HBV maintains a low level of possibly non-infectious replication, after sacrificing its immunologically offending surface antigen, thus avoiding final clearance by the immune system.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of medical

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Bacteria retain certain proteins at their cell envelopes by attaching them in a non-covalent manner to peptidoglycan, using specific protein domains, such as the prominent LysM (Lysin Motif) domain. More than 4000 (Pfam PF01476) proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been found to contain one or more Lysin Motifs. Notably, this collection contains not only truly secreted proteins, but also (outer-)membrane proteins, lipoproteins or proteins bound to the cell wall in a (non-)covalent manner. The motif typically ranges in length from 44 to 65 amino acid residues and binds to various types of peptidoglycan and chitin, most likely recognizing the N-acetylglucosamine moiety. Most bacterial LysM-containing proteins are peptidoglycan hydrolases with various cleavage specificities. Binding of certain LysM proteins to cells of Gram-positive bacteria has been shown to occur at specific sites, as binding elsewhere is hindered by the presence of other cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acids. Interestingly, LysM domains of certain plant kinases enable the plant to recognize its symbiotic bacteria or sense and induce resistance against fungi. This interaction is triggered by chitin-like compounds that are secreted by the symbiotic bacteria or released from fungi, demonstrating an important sensing function of LysMs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Crossbreeding studies in rodents have identified numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are linked to diabetes-related component traits. To identify genetic consensus regions implicated in insulin action and glucose homeostasis, we have performed a meta-analysis of genomewide linkage scans for diabetes-related traits. From a total of 43 published genomewide scans we assembled a nonredundant collection of 153 QTL for glucose levels, insulin levels, and glucose tolerance. Collectively, these studies include data from 48 different parental strains and >11,000 individual animals. The results of the studies were analyzed by the truncated product method (TPM). The analysis revealed significant evidence for linkage of glucose levels, insulin levels, and glucose tolerance to 27 different segments of the mouse genome. The most prominent consensus regions [localized to chromosomes 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 19; logarithm of odds (LOD) scores 10.5-17.4] cover approximately 11% of the mouse genome and collectively contain the peak markers for 47 QTL. Approximately half of these genomic segments also show significant linkage to body weight and adiposity, indicating the presence of multiple obesity-dependent and -independent consensus regions for diabetes-related traits. At least 84 human genetic markers from genomewide scans and >80 candidate genes from human and rodent studies map into the mouse consensus regions for diabetes-related traits, indicating a substantial overlap between the species. Our results provide guidance for the identification of novel candidate genes and demonstrate the presence of numerous distinct consensus QTL regions with highly significant LOD scores that control glucose homeostasis. An interactive physical map of the QTL is available online at http://www.diabesitygenes.org.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Physiological

METHODS: Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and rectum from healthy ducklings and 7-day-old ducklings after oral infection with S. enteritidis at different time points. RESULTS: The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy ducklings was steady and the ERIC-PCR band numbers of the control healthy ducklings were the least with rectum and were the most with caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated ducklings did not obviously change until 24 h after inoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 h to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 d p.i. The prominent bacteria changed because of S. enteritidis infection and the DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected ducklings with SE. CONCLUSION: This study has provided significant data to clarify the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change of healthy and S. enteritidis orally infected ducklings, and valuable

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Circadian oscillator networks rely on a transcriptional activator called CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) in insects and CLOCK/BMAL1 or NPAS2/BMAL1 in mammals. Identifying the targets of this heterodimeric basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor poses challenges and it has been difficult to decipher its specific sequence affinity beyond a canonical E-box motif, except perhaps for some flanking bases contributing weakly to the binding energy. Thus, no good computational model presently exists for predicting CLK/CYC, CLOCK/BMAL1, or NPAS2/BMAL1 targets. Here, we use a comparative genomics approach and first study the conservation properties of the best-known circadian enhancer: a 69-bp element upstream of the Drosophila melanogaster period gene. This fragment shows a signal involving the presence of two closely spaced E-box-like motifs, a configuration that we can also detect in the other four prominent CLK/CYC target genes in flies: timeless, vrille, Pdp1, and cwo. This allows for the training of a probabilistic sequence model that we test using functional genomics datasets. We find that the predicted sequences are overrepresented in promoters of genes induced in a recent study by a glucocorticoid receptor-CLK fusion protein. We then scanned the mouse genome with the fly model and found that many known CLOCK/BMAL1 targets harbor sequences matching our consensus. Moreover, the phase of predicted cyclers in liver agreed with known CLOCK/BMAL1 regulation. Taken together, we built a predictive model for CLK/CYC or CLOCK/BMAL1-bound cis-enhancers through the integration of comparative and functional genomics data. Finally, a deeper phylogenetic analysis reveals that the link between the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex and the circadian cis-element dates back to before insects and vertebrates diverged.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PLoS computational

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive deficits in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prompted a search for HCV in brain. RESULTS: HCV was present in the brains of 7 (54%) of 13 patients with viremia, as determined by 5' UTR and E1 (envelope 1) gene analysis. Brain HCV RNA consensus sequences differed from those in plasma and liver in 4 (57%) of 7 patients. The quality of HCV RNA from postmortem brain and liver was assessed and demonstrated to be suitable for sequence analysis. Quasispecies analysis revealed that several mutations present in clones from >1 brain region were absent in clones from liver and plasma. Brain-specific mutations defined several families of related sequences. The patterns of brain-specific mutations in these families were consistent with the evolution of HCV RNA from a common ancestor. Single-nucleotide-polymorphism analysis confirmed that a prominent brain-specific mutation constituted approximately 10% of HCV RNA in cerebellum and medulla but that this mutation was undetectable in the liver and plasma of the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces novel methods for assessing RNA from postmortem samples. It increases the reported cases of HCV in the brain, provides the first E1 sequences from the brain, and contributes to the growing evidence that HCV replicates and evolves within the brain.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of infectious

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Spermatogenesis is comprised of a series of highly regulated developmental changes that transform the precursor germ cell into a highly specialized spermatozoon. The last phase of spermatogenesis, termed spermiogenesis, involves dramatic morphological change including formation of the acrosome, elongation and condensation of the nucleus, formation of the flagella, and disposal of unnecessary cytoplasm. A prominent cytoskeletal component of the developing spermatid is the manchette, a unique microtubular structure that surrounds the nucleus of the developing spermatid and is thought to assist in both the reshaping of the nucleus and redistribution of spermatid cytoplasm. Although the molecular motor KIFC1 has been shown to associate with the manchette, its precise role in function of the manchette and the identity of its testis specific protein partners are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify proteins in the testis that interact with KIFC1 using a yeast 2 hybrid screen of a testis cDNA library. RESULTS: Thirty percent of the interacting clones identified in our screen contain an identical cDNA encoding a 40 kD protein. This interacting protein has 4 leucine-rich repeats in its amino terminal half and is expressed primarily in the testis; therefore we have named this protein testis leucine-rich repeat protein or TLRR. TLRR was also found to associate tightly with the KIFC1 targeting domain using affinity chromatography. In addition to the leucine-rich repeats, TLRR contains a consensus-binding site for protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Immunocytochemistry using a TLRR specific antibody demonstrates that this protein is found near the manchette of developing spermatids. CONCLUSION: We have identified a previously uncharacterized leucine-rich repeat protein that is expressed abundantly in the testis and associates with the manchette of developing spermatids, possibly through its interaction with the KIFC1 molecular motor. TLRR is homologous to a class of regulatory subunits for PP1, a central phosphatase in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins that is key to modulation of many intracellular processes. TLRR may serve to target this important signaling molecule near the nucleus of developing spermatids in order to control the cellular rearrangements of spermiogenesis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC cell biology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Amino Acid Sequence","Animals","Base Sequence","Binding Sites","Cell Differentiation","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred Strains","Molecular Sequence Data","Organ Specificity","Protein Binding","Protein Phosphatase 1","Protein Subunits","Proteins","Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","Spermatids","Spermatogenesis","Substrate Specificity","Testis","beta Karyopherins"]},"pmid":"18237440","title":"Identification of a novel Leucine-rich repeat protein and candidate PP1 regulatory subunit expressed in developing spermatids.","year":"2008"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Functional alterations of components of the endogenous cannabinoid system, in particular of the cannabinoid receptor 1 protein (CB1), are hypothetical contributors to many of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia. Variants within the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1) have been shown to be directly associated with the hebephrenic form of schizophrenia in a Japanese population. This finding, however, has yet to be replicated. In the present study we sought to study the same (AAT)n-repeat microsatellite of the CNR1 gene which showed association to hebephrenic schizophrenia in Japan, and to investigate whether this microsatellite showed association to a hebephrenic type of schizophrenia in a family-based association study in a population of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. The Lifetime Dimensions of Psychosis Scale and a best estimate consensus process were utilized to identify subjects with schizophrenia who had an elevated lifetime dimensional score for negative and disorganized symptoms, which we used as a proxy for \"hebephrenia.\" Using the Family Based Association Test we found association of these hebephrenic subjects and the (AAT)n-repeat marker of the CNR1 (multi-allelic P = 0.0368). Our hypothesis that an association with the (AAT)n-repeat marker of CNR1 would not be found with the more general type of schizophrenia was also confirmed. Schizophrenic subjects with prominent lifetime scores for disorganization and negative symptoms (dimension for hebephrenia) are associated with the CNR1 gene and present a type of symptomatology that resembles chronic cannabinoid-induced psychosis. The current finding points to the possibility of different genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying different types of schizophrenia.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"American journal of medical genetics.

[Zadina, J.E., Hackler, L., Ge, L.-J., Kastin, A.J., 1997. A potent and selective endogenous agonist for the mu-opiate receptor. Nature 386, 499-5502] synthesized and screened other Gly(4)-substituted peptides, culminating in the synthesis of Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH(2) (endomorphin-1), which displayed high affinity and selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor. The amidated peptide was then isolated from bovine brain frontal cortex, as was a related peptide, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH(2) (endomorphin-2), that displayed similar high affinity and selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor. The biosynthesis of the endomorphins in the brain remains obscure, since the putative precursor proteins for the peptides have not been identified. With the completion of the human genome sequencing project, we hypothesized that we should uncover the biological precursors of the peptides using a bioinformatic approach to search the current human proteome for proteins that contained the endomorphin peptide sequences followed by Gly-Lys/Arg, the consensus sequence for peptide alpha-amidation and precursor cleavage. Twelve proteins were identified that contained the endomorphin-1 Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe sequence, however none contained the Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-Gly sequence necessary for alpha-amidation. Twenty-two distinct proteins contained the endomorphin-2 tetrapeptide sequence, and two of those contained the sequence, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-Gly, however, none contained the requisite peptide-Gly-Lys/Arg sequence. Western blot analysis using an endomorphin-2 antibody detected 4 prominent proteins in mouse brain, necessitating reinterpretation of previous immunocytolocalization studies in the brain. Screening of the current human proteome yielded no evidence for endomorphin precursor proteins based on accepted biochemical criteria.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Life

To investigate the context dependency of this transcriptional response and eliminate growth rate-dependent variations in transcription, yeast was grown under several chemostat regimens, resulting in various carbon (glucose), nitrogen (ammonium), zinc, and oxygen supplies. A robust set of genes that responded consistently to Zn limitation was identified, and the set enabled the definition of the Zn-specific Zap1p regulon, comprised of 26 genes and characterized by a broader zinc-responsive element consensus (MHHAACCBYNMRGGT) than so far described. Most surprising was the Zn-dependent regulation of genes involved in storage carbohydrate metabolism. Their concerted down-regulation was physiologically relevant as revealed by a substantial decrease in glycogen and trehalose cellular content under Zn limitation. An unexpectedly large number of genes were synergistically or antagonistically regulated by oxygen and Zn availability. This combinatorial regulation suggested a more prominent involvement of Zn in mitochondrial biogenesis and function than hitherto identified.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Applied and

Increasing evidence suggests that telomerase may bear functions other than telomere elongation. We investigated whether telomerase is expressed in the continuously growing goldfish retina. Telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay reveals telomerase activity in goldfish retina. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot show that telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) is expressed at both mRNA and protein levels. Localization of TERT by immunohistochemistry indicates prominent expression of TERT in the outer nuclear layer, the inner nuclear layer, and, in a small population of cells, in the ganglion cell layer. Coexpression of TERT with proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity is found in rod progenitor cells. These results suggest the role of telomerase in vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) other than telomere maintenance, such as regulation of cell cycle progression and maintenance of retinal cell

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The ade6-M26 meiotic recombination hot spot of fission yeast is defined by a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-like heptanucleotide sequence, 5'-ATGACGT-3', which acts as a binding site for the Atf1/Pcr1 heterodimeric transcription factor required for hot spot activation. We previously demonstrated that the local chromatin around the M26 sequence motif alters to exhibit higher sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease before the initiation of meiotic recombination. In this study, we have examined whether or not such alterations in chromatin occur at natural meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. At one of the most prominent DSB sites, mbs1 (meiotic break site 1), the chromatin structure has a constitutively accessible configuration at or near the DSB sites. The establishment of the open chromatin state and DSB formation are independent of the CRE-binding transcription factor, Atf1. Analysis of the chromatin configuration at CRE-dependent DSB sites revealed both differences from and similarities to mbs1. For example, the tdh1+ locus, which harbors a CRE consensus sequence near the DSB site, shows a meiotically induced open chromatin configuration, similar to ade6-M26. In contrast, the cds1+ locus is similar to mbs1 in that it exhibits a constitutive open configuration. Importantly, Atf1 is required for the open chromatin formation in both tdh1+ and cds1+. These results suggest that CRE-dependent meiotic chromatin changes are intrinsic processes related to DSB formation in fission yeast meiosis. In addition, the results suggest that the chromatin configuration in natural meiotic recombination hot spots can be classified into at least three distinct categories: (i) an Atf1-CRE-independent constitutively open chromatin configuration, (ii) an Atf1-CRE-dependent meiotically induced open chromatin configuration, and (iii) an Atf1-CRE-dependent constitutively open chromatin configuration.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Eukaryotic cell","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Activating Transcription Factor 1","Chromatin","Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly","Cyclic AMP","DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded","Exodeoxyribonucleases","Genome, Fungal","Meiosis","Mitosis","Phosphoproteins","Recombination, Genetic","Response Elements","Schizosaccharomyces","Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins","Transcription, Genetic"]},"pmid":"17827346","title":"Multiple modes of chromatin configuration at natural meiotic recombination hot spots in fission yeast.","year":"2007"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which voltage-sensitive K(+) (Kv)4 channels inactivate and recover from inactivation are presently unresolved. There is a general consensus, however, that Shaker-like N- and P/C-type mechanisms are likely not involved. Kv4 channels also display prominent inactivation from preactivated closed states [closed-state inactivation (CSI)], a process that appears to be absent in Shaker channels. As in Shaker channels, voltage sensitivity in Kv4 channels is thought to be conferred by positively charged residues localized to the fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of the voltage-sensing domain. To investigate the role of S4 positive charge in Kv4.3 gating transitions, we analyzed the effects of charge elimination at each positively charged arginine (R) residue by mutation to the uncharged residue alanine (A). We first demonstrated that R290A, R293A, R296A, and R302A mutants each alter basic activation characteristics consistent with positive charge removal. We then found strong evidence that recovery from inactivation is coupled to deactivation, showed that the precise location of the arginine residues within S4 plays an important role in the degree of development of CSI and recovery from CSI, and demonstrated that the development of CSI can be sequentially uncoupled from activation by R296A, specifically. Taken together, these results extend our current understanding of Kv4.3 gating transitions.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"American journal of physiology.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Human malaria parasites, including the most lethal Plasmodium falciparum, are increasingly resistant to existing antimalarial drugs. One remarkable opportunity to selectively target P. falciparum stems from the unique AT-richness of its genome (80% A/T, relative to 60% in human DNA). To rationally explore this opportunity, we used drugs (adozelesin and bizelesin) which distinctly target AT-rich minisatellites and an in silico approach for genome-wide analysis previously experimentally validated in human cells [Woynarowski JM, Trevino AV, Rodriguez KA, Hardies SC, Benham CJ. AT-rich islands in genomic DNA as a novel target for AT-specific DNA-reactive antitumor drugs. J Biol Chem 2001;276:40555-66]. Both drugs demonstrate a potent, rapid and irreversible inhibition of the cultured P. falciparum (50% inhibition at 110 and 10+/-2.3 pM, respectively). This antiparasital activity reflects most likely drug binding to specific super-AT-rich regions. Relative to the human genome, the P. falciparum genome shows 3.9- and 7-fold higher frequency of binding sites for adozelesin and bizelesin, respectively. The distribution of these sites is non-random with the most prominent clusters found in large unique minisatellites [median size 3.5 kbp of nearly pure A/T, with multiple converging repeats but no shared consensus other than (A/T)(n)]. Each of the fourteen P. falciparum chromosomes contains only one such \"super-AT island\" located within approximately 3-7.5 kbp of gene-free and nucleosome-free loci. Important functions of super-AT islands are suggested by their exceptional predicted potential to serve as matrix attachment regions (MARs) and a precise co-localization with the putative centromeres. CONCLUSION: Super-AT islands, identified as unique domains in the P. falciparum genome with presumably crucial functions, offer therapeutically exploitable opportunity for new antimalarial strategies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular and biochemical parasitology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Alkylating Agents","Animals","Antimalarials","Base Composition","Binding Sites","Centromere","Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids","Cyclohexenes","DNA, Protozoan","Genomic Islands","Humans","Indoles","Inhibitory Concentration 50","Molecular Structure","Parasitic Sensitivity Tests","Pharmacogenetics","Plasmodium falciparum","Sensitivity and Specificity","Urea"]},"pmid":"17524501","title":"Pharmacogenomic analyses of targeting the AT-rich malaria parasite genome with AT-specific alkylating drugs.","year":"2007"}

Computational molecular biology has emerged as one of the most exciting interdisciplinary fields, riding on the success of the ongoing Human Genome Project, which culminated in the 2001 announcement of the complete sequencing of the human genome. The field has currently benefited from concepts and theoretical results obtained by different scientific research communities, including genetics, biochemistry, and computer science. It is only in the past few years that it has been shown that a large number of molecular biology problems can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems, including sequence alignment problems, genome rearrangement problems, string selection and comparison problems, and protein structure prediction and recognition. This paper provides a detailed description of some among the most interesting molecular biology problems that can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems and proposes a new heuristic to find improved solutions for a particular class of them, known as the far from most string problem.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Mathematical biosciences","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computational Biology","uri":{"id":"D019295","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Human","uri":{"id":"D015894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Genome Project","uri":{"id":"D016045","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Alignment","uri":{"id":"D016415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computational Biology","uri":{"id":"D019295","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers, Molecular","uri":{"id":"D039301","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biochemistry","uri":{"id":"D001671","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biology","uri":{"id":"D001695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Science","uri":{"id":"D012586","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Humans","uri":{"id":"D006801","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computational Biology","uri":{"id":"D019295","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D008957","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Rearrangement","uri":{"id":"D015321","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Human","uri":{"id":"D015894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Alignment","uri":{"id":"D016415","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":["Algorithms","Computational Biology","Consensus Sequence","Gene Rearrangement","Genome, Human","Humans","Models, Genetic","Sequence Alignment"]},"pmid":"17512558","title":"On some optimization problems in molecular biology.","year":"2007"}

PARSIMOV analysis demonstrated clear functional heterochronies associated both with basal branches within the phylogeny and with terminal speciation events. A consensus of changes inferred under both accelerated transformation and delayed transformation optimizations identified four heterochronies where the direction of movement was known plus six twin heterochronies where the relative movements of the two events could not be assigned. On average, 0.5 and 0.58 events were inferred to have changed their position in the developmental sequence on internal and terminal branches of the phylogeny, respectively; these values are comparable with frequencies of sequence heterochrony reported in mammals. Directional heterochronies such as the early occurrence of body flexing in relation to the ontogeny of the eye spots, heart beat, and free swimming events occurred convergently and/or at different levels (i.e., familial, generic, and species) within the phylogeny.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The error-prone replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enables it to continuously evade host CD8+ T-cell responses. The observed transmission, and potential accumulation, of CD8+ T-cell escape mutations in the population may suggest a gradual adaptation of HIV-1 to immune pressures. Recent reports, however, have highlighted the propensity of some escape mutations to revert upon transmission to a new host in order to restore efficient replication capacity. To more specifically address the role of reversions in early HIV-1 evolution, we examined sequence polymorphisms arising across the HIV-1 genome in seven subjects followed longitudinally 1 year from primary infection. As expected, numerous nonsynonymous mutations were associated with described CD8+ T-cell epitopes, supporting a prominent role for cellular immune responses in driving early HIV-1 evolution. Strikingly, however, a substantial proportion of substitutions (42%) reverted toward the clade B consensus sequence, with nearly one-quarter of them located within defined CD8 epitopes not restricted by the contemporary host's HLA. More importantly, these reversions arose significantly faster than forward mutations, with the most rapidly reverting mutations preferentially arising within structurally conserved residues. These data suggest that many transmitted mutations likely incur a fitness cost that is recovered through retrieval of an optimal, or ancestral, form of the virus. The propensity of mutations to revert may limit the accumulation of immune pressure-driven mutations in the population, thus preserving critical CD8+ T-cell epitopes as vaccine targets, and argue against an unremitting adaptation of HIV-1 to host immune pressures.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of

This review focuses on quantitative and qualitative aspects of the prominent D(b)NP366- and D(b)PA224-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in virus-infected B6 mice. The different virus-specific effector and memory sets are compared by phenotypic [CD62L, interleukin-7 receptor-alpha (IL-7Ralpha), and IL-15Rbeta expression] and functional [interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-2 production] analyses. Most clonotypes [defined by T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3beta sequence] generated during the acute phase of infection survive into memory, with those expressing the more consensus 'canonical' TCRs being the major contributors to the recall response. The extent of clonal expansion and the size of memory CD8+ T-cell populations has been characterized for mice challenged with either wildtype or mutant viruses, where broadly equivalent D(b)NP366 and D(b)PA224 expression was achieved by disabling the peptides in their native configuration, then expressing them in the viral neuraminidase protein. Combining the clonotypic and antigen dose analyses led to a somewhat mechanistic conclusion that the magnitude of any virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response will be a direct function of antigen dose and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) modulates xeno- and endobiotic hepatotoxicity by regulating detoxification pathways. Whether activation of CAR may also protect against liver injury by directly blocking apoptosis is unknown. To address this question, CAR wild-type (CAR+/+) and CAR knockout (CAR-/-) mice were treated with the CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) and then with the Fas agonist Jo2 or with concanavalin A (ConA). Following the administration of Jo2, hepatocyte apoptosis, liver injury, and animal fatalities were abated in TCPOBOP-treated CAR+/+ but not in CAR-/- mice. Likewise, acute and chronic ConA-mediated liver injury and fibrosis were also reduced in wild-type versus CAR(-/-) TCPOBOP-treated mice. The proapoptotic proteins Bak (Bcl-2 antagonistic killer) and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) were depleted in livers from TCPOBOP-treated CAR+/+ mice. In contrast, mRNA expression of the antiapoptotic effector myeloid cell leukemia factor-1 (Mcl-1) was increased fourfold. Mcl-1 promoter activity was increased by transfection with CAR and administration of TCPOBOP in hepatoma cells, consistent with a direct CAR effect on Mcl-1 transcription. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis of a putative CAR consensus binding sequence on the Mcl-1 promoter decreased Mcl-1 promoter activity. Mcl-1 transgenic animals demonstrated little to no acute liver injury after administration of Jo2, signifying Mcl-1 cytoprotection. In conclusion, these observations support a prominent role for CAR cytoprotection against Fas-mediated hepatocyte injury via a mechanism involving upregulation of Mcl-1 and, likely, downregulation of Bax and Bak.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Hepatology (Baltimore,

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The p53 tumor suppressor plays critical roles in diverse cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis through transcriptional control of its target genes. Identification and characterization of new p53 target genes will advance our understanding of how p53 exerts its multiple regulatory functions. In this article, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP2) is a novel transcription target of p53 in mediating apoptosis. Moreover, we identify a 10-bp perfect palindrome motif (CTGGCGCCAG) in the MKP2 promoter as a new binding site for p53 to activate the MKP2 gene. This GC-rich palindrome is completely different from the consensus p53 binding sequence. Induction of MKP2 is highly responsive to oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, the p53-dependent induction of MKP2 is prominent only in the cellular response to stimuli leading to apoptosis but not to cell cycle arrest. In response to oxidative stress, MKP2 is not only required for p53-mediated apoptosis, but ectopic MKP2 expression can also enhance apoptotic responses even independent of p53. These data suggest that p53 regulates distinct genes via different binding mechanisms and that MKP2 is an essential target of p53 in signaling apoptosis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"A perennial ryegrass cDNA clone encoding a putative glycine-rich RNA binding protein (LpGRP1) was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from crown tissues of cold-treated plants. The deduced polypeptide sequence consists of 107 amino acids with a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a single C-terminal glycine-rich domain. The sequence showed extensive homology to glycine-rich RNA binding proteins previously identified in other plant species. LpGRP1-specific genomic DNA sequence was isolated by an inverse PCR amplification. A single intron which shows conserved locations in plant genes was detected between the sequence motifs encoding RNP-1 and RNP-2 consensus protein domains. A significant increase in the mRNA level of LpGRP1 was detected in root, crown and leaf tissues during the treatment of plants at 4 degrees C, through which freezing tolerance is attained. The increase in the mRNA level was prominent at least 2 h after the commencement of the cold treatment, and persisted for at least 1 week. Changes in mRNA level induced by cold treatment were more obvious than those due to treatments with abscisic acid (ABA) and drought. The LpGRP1 protein was found to localise in the nucleus in onion epidermal cells, suggesting that it may be involved in pre-mRNA processing. The LpGRP1 gene locus was mapped to linkage group 2.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Human cytomegalovirus encodes several proteins that interfere with expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. The unique short protein 2 (US2) binds to many MHC class I allomorphs in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing cell surface expression of the class I molecule in question. The molecular interactions underlying US2 binding to MHC class I molecules and its allele specificity have not been fully clarified. In the present study, we first compared the sequences and the structures of US2 retained versus non-retained human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I allomorphs to identify MHC residues of potential importance for US2 binding. On the basis of this analysis, 18 individual HLA-A2 mutants were generated and the ability of full-length US2 to bind wild-type and mutated HLA-A2 complexes was assessed. We demonstrate that Arg181 plays a critical role in US2-mediated inhibition of HLA-A2 cell surface expression. The structural comparison of all known crystal structures of HLA-A2 either alone, or in complex with T cell receptor or the CD8 co-receptor, indicates that binding of US2 to HLA-A2 results in a unique, large conformational change of the side chain of Arg181. However, although the presence of Arg181 seems to be a prerequisite for US2 binding to HLA-A2, it is not sufficient for binding to all MHC class I alleles.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Eukaryotic genomes are divided into chromatin domains, which are thought to represent independent regulatory units. Typically, these domains are flanked by bordering elements that insulate the transcription unit from outside influences. Borders also demarcate the range of action for enhancer-like elements within the domain as they are formed around dominant genomic structures such as DNAse I hypersensitive sites (HS). Here we describe an efficient strategy to localize these elements. Our procedure is based on a computational method and predictions are verified by classical in vivo and in vitro procedures. Exemplified by the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) domain it proves its potential to provide novel insights into remote control principles of transcription. Sites with secondary-structure forming potential are localized by the analysis of stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) properties and the associating factors are characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). These studies reveal far upstream factor binding sites within the IFN-beta domains of both humans and mice. A prominent example is YY1, a transcription factor that not only recognizes a core consensus motif, ATGG, but, in addition, the structural context, which is evident from characteristic imprints in the respective SIDD-profiles.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Gene","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insulator

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"We have previously shown that parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) transcript levels in the osteosarcoma cell-line, UMR106-01 cells. In the present study we examined the molecular basis for the PTH induction of IGFBP-5 mRNA in these cells. PTH had no effect on the half-life of the IGFBP-5 transcript but did stimulate the transactivation of the proximal 889 base pairs of the rat IGFBP 5' flanking region in a luciferase fusion construct, suggesting that PTH stimulates transcript levels through transcriptional mechanisms. Progressive 5' deletions to -59 base pairs of the proximal promoter region had no effect on PTH induction of transactivation, indicating that an element existed within the first -59 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site that was responsive to PTH. Within the -59 base pairs there are CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), E-box, nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) and activator protein-2 (AP-2) elements. Mutation of the C/EBP, E-box or NF-1 elements had no effect on the ability of PTH to induce the transactivation of the IGFBP-5 promoter. Mutation of the AP-2 element resulted in a 40% reduction of PTH-stimulated luciferase activity. When three tandem repeats of the AP-2 consensus sequence were fused to a luciferase reporter, PTH stimulated a 25% increase in reporter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using UMR106-01 cell nuclear extracts showed that PTH caused a prominent shifted band in a probe spanning the region containing all four elements. The shifted band was almost completely absent when the probe contained a mutated AP-2 element. These results suggest that the AP-2 element functions in the PTH induction of IGFBP-5 gene expression.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of molecular

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Surface expression of ion channels and receptors often depends on intrinsic sequence motifs that control their intracellular transport along the secretory pathway. Although members of the Kir2.x subfamily share two such motifs - a diacidic ER export motif and a positively charged Golgi export motif - they strongly differ in their surface expression. Whereas Kir2.1 shows prominent plasma membrane localization, Kir2.4 channels accumulate within the Golgi complex. By constructing chimeras between Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 subunits, a stretch of 20 amino acids was identified in the Kir2.1 C-terminus that is both necessary and sufficient to promote anterograde transport of Kir channel subunits at the level of trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. The core element of the identified sequence bears a tyrosine-dependent YXXPhi consensus motif for adaptin binding, with the flanking residues determining its functional efficiency. As the signal is dominant in promoting surface transport of Kir2.1/Kir2.4 channel heteromers and is recognized by both the epithelial and neuronal intracellular sorting machinery, the preferential Golgi export of Kir2.1 will control the stoichiometry of Kir2.x heteromers expressed on the cell surface.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of cell

We compared the genomes of 10 H. pylori strains from Ladakh, North India. Molecular analysis was carried out to identify rearrangements within and outside the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) and DNA sequence divergence in candidate genes. Analyses of virulence genes (such as the cag PAI as a whole, cagA, vacA, iceA, oipA, babB, and the plasticity cluster) revealed that H. pylori strains from Ladakh are genetically distinct and possibly less virulent than the isolates from East Asian countries, such as China and Japan. Phylogenetic analyses based on the cagA-glr motifs, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus patterns, repetitive extragenic palindromic signatures, the glmM gene mutations, and several genomic markers representing fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphisms revealed that Ladakhi strains share features of the Indo-European, as well as the East Asian, gene pools.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Enoyl-ACP reductase is a catalytic component of the fatty acid synthetase (FAS) type II system in plants that is involved in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids. A cDNA encoding an enoyl-ACP reductase responsible for the removal of the trans-unsaturated double bonds to form saturated acyl-ACP has been isolated from a library made from ripening fruits of Olea europaea L. The predicted protein contains 393 amino acid residues including a consensus chloroplast specific transit peptide. A strong homology was observed when olive enoyl-ACP reductase aligned with other plant sequences. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that enoyl-ACP reductase is encoded by a single gene in olives. Northern hybridization showed a transient expression of the enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR) gene at early stages of drupe (5-7 weeks after flowering, WAF), embryo and endosperm (13-16 WAF) while in mesocarp (13-19 WAF) the expression remained at high levels. In situ hybridization showed particularly prominent expression in the palisade and vascular tissue of young leaves, the tapetum, developing pollen grains and vascular tissue of anthers and to less extent in the embryo sac and transmitting tissue of the carpel. The distinctive spatial and temporal regulation of the ENR gene is consistent with major roles, not only in thylakoid membrane formation and fatty acid deposition, but also in the provision of precursor molecules for the biosynthesis of oxilipins that are important in plant tissues involved in transportation and reproduction.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Plant physiology and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Many ion channels are regulated by lipids, but prominent motifs for lipid binding have not been identified in most ion channels. Recently, we reported that phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLC-gamma1) binds to and regulates TRPC3 channels, components of agonist-induced Ca2+ entry into cells. This interaction requires a domain in PLC-gamma1 that includes a partial pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-a consensus lipid-binding and protein-binding sequence. We have developed a gestalt algorithm to detect hitherto 'invisible' PH and PH-like domains, and now report that the partial PH domain of PLC-gamma1 interacts with a complementary partial PH-like domain in TRPC3 to elicit lipid binding and cell-surface expression of TRPC3. Our findings imply a far greater abundance of PH domains than previously appreciated, and suggest that intermolecular PH-like domains represent a widespread signalling mode.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nature","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ion

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"A 1.3 kb satellite DNA from a size defined genomic library of mammal Bubalus bubalis was cloned and sequenced. The clone pSB1 is AT rich with 447 A (33.6%), 262 C (19.7%), 240 G (19.0%) and 383 T (28.8%). There were about 1400 copies of contig in the bubaline genome but it did not uncover allele length variation when used as probe in conjunction with a number of restriction enzymes. The contig pSB1 is not conserved evolutionarily and cross hybridizes only with the Bovideae family. A set of primers from 5' (nt 422 to 441) and 3' (nt 962 to 947) deduced from the clone used for PCR amplification with four members of the Bovideae family gave the expected 530 bp band of equal intensity indicating a similar number of copies in all the four species namely Bos indicus, Capra hircus, Ovis aries and Bubalus bubalis. Expression studies with pSB1 following slot-blot hybridization with total RNA isolated from ovary, testes, kidney, lung and spleen revealed varying signal intensities in all the tissues with a most prominent signal in spleen but a faint one in ovary. Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of several eukaryotic transcriptional elements such as NF-E1, Poly-A signal, lariat consensus sequences, and CTF/NF1 binding sites. Blast search showed 90% sequence similarity with the reverse transcriptase gene of Bos taurus and sequences from nt 283 to 636 within the contig showed highly conserved reverse transcriptase like signatures along with N-glycosylation and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. From the data we conclude that the pSB1 representing satellite DNA is associated with transcribing sequences. The prospect of identifying functional genes linked with the satellite fraction in higher vertebrates is discussed.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a prominent role in cell growth and development. Its regulation in humans is complex and incompletely understood. In this study, 12 new polymorphisms were discovered in the 5'-regulatory region of EGFR gene and 2 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (-216G/T and -191C/A) were found in the essential promoter area, one of which is located in a Sp1 recognition site (-216). Transient transfection in human cancer and primary cell lines showed significantly different promoter activity between the two most common haplotypes (-216G-191C and -216T-191C). The replacement of G by T at position -216 increases the promoter activity by 30%. A transient transfection assay in the Sp1-deficient cell line (Schneider cell line 2) showed a strong dependence of EGFR promoter activity on Sp1 and confirmed the effect of the aforementioned polymorphisms. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay also showed a significantly higher binding efficiency of nuclear protein or pure Sp1 protein to the T allele compared with the G allele. We then investigated the allelic imbalance of EGFR transcription in fibroblast cell lines with heterozygous genotype at -216G/T but C/C homozygous genotype at -191C/A. The expression of mRNA carrying T-C haplotype was significantly stronger compared with that of G-C haplotype (P < 0.02). Thus, we successfully showed that a common polymorphism in the EGFR promoter was associated with altered promoter activity and gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings have implications for cancer etiology and therapy and may also be relevant to the inherited susceptibility of other common diseases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Cell transformation by simian virus 40 (SV40) results mostly from the highly oncogenic activities of the large T antigen (LT), which corrupts the cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. The most prominent LT targets are the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53. Here we report that LT binds directly to Fbw7, the substrate recognition component of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase and a human tumor suppressor. LT binding mislocalizes the nucleolar Fbw7gamma isoform to the nucleoplasm. Interestingly, the binding of LT to Fbw7 occurs via a decoy phospho-epitope within the C terminus of LT that closely mimics the consensus Cdc4 phospho-degron found within Fbw7 substrates. We demonstrate that, using this mode of interaction, LT can interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover in vivo and causes increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Our data suggest that LT competes with cellular proteins for Fbw7 binding in a substrate-like fashion.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of biological

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of the familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) gene (MEFV) in human synovial fibroblasts. METHODS: MEFV messenger RNA in synovial fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was analyzed by semiquantitative and real-time polymerase chain reaction and ribonuclease protection assay. The subcellular localization of pyrin, the MEFV product, was determined in transfected synovial fibroblasts and HeLa cells with plasmids encoding pyrin isoforms. Native pyrin was detected with an antipyrin antibody. RESULTS: MEFV was expressed in synovial fibroblasts, but not in chondrocytes. Four alternatively spliced transcripts were identified: an extension of exon 8 (exon 8ext) resulting in a frameshift that predicts a truncated protein lacking exons 9 and 10, the addition of an exon (exon 4a) predicting a truncated protein at exon 5, the in-frame substitution of exon 2a for exon 2, and the previously described removal of exon 2 (exon 2Delta). Exon 8ext transcripts represented 27% of the total message population in synovial fibroblasts. All other alternatively spliced transcripts were rare. Consensus and alternatively spliced transcripts were induced by lipopolysaccharide in synovial fibroblasts and PBLs. In transfected cells, the proteins encoded by all highly expressed splice forms were cytoplasmic. In contrast, native pyrin was predominantly nuclear in synovial fibroblasts, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, but was cytoplasmic in monocytes. CONCLUSION: Several MEFV transcripts are expressed and inducible in synovial fibroblasts. A prominent isoform lacks the C-terminal domain that contains the majority of mutations found in patients with FMF. While recombinant forms of all major pyrin isoforms are cytoplasmic, native pyrin is nuclear in several cell types. Thus, mechanisms in addition to splicing patterns must control pyrin's subcellular distribution.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Arthritis and

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The CaValpha2delta auxiliary subunit is a glycosylated protein that regulates the trafficking and function of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. One of the most prominent roles of CaValpha2delta is to increase whole-cell Ca2+ current amplitude. Using N-glycosidase F and truncated forms of CaValpha2delta, earlier studies suggested an important role for N-linked glycosylation in current stimulation. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in HEK-293 cells to examine the impact of individual glycosylation sites within the CaValpha2delta subunit on the regulation of Ba2+ currents through recombinant Ca2+ channels. We found two N-glycosylation consensus sites (NX(S/T)) in the extracellular alpha2 domain of the protein that are functional. Substitution of asparagines for glutamines at amino acid positions 136 and 184 rendered these sites non-functional as shown by patch-clamp experiments. These results corroborate that N-glycosylation is required for the CaValpha2delta subunit-induced current stimulation and suggest that sites N136 and N184 are directly involved in this action. Likewise, N136Q and N184Q mutations prevented whole-cell current stimulation without altering its kinetic properties, suggesting a regulation on the number of functional channels at the plasma membrane.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"FEBS

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Alu repeats are the most common type of repetitive DNA sequences dispersed throughout the human genome. Technical advances in the field of cytogenetics and molecular biology have facilitated the analysis of epithelial tumors and hematologic malignancies which has led to the observation of Alu elements in and near sites often involved in chromosomal rearrangements. Repair mechanisms of double strand breaks (DSB) such as homol-ogous recombination (HR) may rely on the sequence homology of Alu repeats, potentially leading to chromosomal rearrange-ments. Databases have confirmed the strong association between Alu repeats, specifically the 26 bp consensus sequence and chro-mosomal regions involved in deletions and translocations. Although the Alu repetitive sequence is a potential \"hotspot\" during homologous recombination, there are other cellular mech-anisms that may play a more prominent role in the initiation of chromosomal rearrangements.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid","uri":{"id":"D012091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interspersed Repetitive Sequences","uri":{"id":"D020071","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus Sequence","uri":{"id":"D016384","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid","uri":{"id":"D012091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Human","uri":{"id":"D015894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Homology","uri":{"id":"D017385","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, DNA","uri":{"id":"D017422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hematologic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D019337","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alu Elements","uri":{"id":"D020087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Homologous Recombination","uri":{"id":"D059765","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biology","uri":{"id":"D001695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recombination, Genetic","uri":{"id":"D011995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytogenetics","uri":{"id":"D003582","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"15345864","title":"AluElements: Repetitive DNA as Facilitators of Chromosomal Rearrangement.","year":"2004"}

However, the global importance of TBP recruitment in determining the absolute and changing levels of transcription across the genome is not known. We used a genomic approach to explore the relationship between TBP recruitment to promoters and global gene expression profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data indicate that first, RNA polymerase III promoters are the most prominent binding targets of TBP in vivo. Second, the steady-state transcript levels of genes throughout the genome are proportional to the occupancy of their promoters by TBP, and changes in the expression levels of these genes are closely correlated with changes in TBP recruitment to their promoters. Third, a consensus TATA element does not appear to be a major determinant of either TBP binding or gene expression throughout the genome. Our results indicate that the recruitment of TBP to promoters in vivo is of universal importance in determining gene expression levels in yeast, regardless of the nature of the core promoter or the type of activator or repressor that may mediate changes in transcription.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Salmon are subjected to hyperosmotic stress during transition from freshwater to the marine environment. A variety of mechanisms have evolved to allow movement of the animal from a hydrating to a dehydrating environment. Using differential assay of mRNA expression, a 1.3 kb transcript was found to be upregulated in branchial lamellae of salmon exposed to hyperosmotic conditions. The transcript contains an open reading frame of 618 nt coding for a 205 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa. The putative protein, dubbed salmon glycine-rich RNA binding protein (SGRP), possesses a high degree of identity (>70%) with the cold inducible RNA binding proteins (CIRP) of mammals and amphibians and contains the canonical features of these proteins including a single RNA recognition motif (RRM), high glycine content and conserved flanking motifs. SGRP mRNA was observed to increase in response to hyperosmotic stress of branchial tissue with maximum levels of expression after 48 h of exposure. Transcript also was observed in liver, kidney and heart but was not upregulated significantly by osmotic stress in these tissues. Exposure of isolated lamellae to heat stress and sodium arsenite, known inducers of hsps, did not stimulate accumulation of SGRP transcript. Similarly, inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide and the MAPK and MEK signal transduction pathways with SB202190 and PD98059 failed to alter expression of the gene. Of significance was the absence of an increase in expression of SGRP in response to cold stress (DeltaT = 5 and 12 degrees C for 12 and 24 h). The findings of this research suggest that ectothermic salmon inhabiting boreal waters possess a protein analogous to the CIRPs currently identified in mammals and amphibians. In contrast to the function of CIRPs, SGRP appears to have a more prominent role in adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions rather than cold stress.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biochimie","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Signal

Gene expression along the tract was studied through the random sequencing of a total of 16 412 clones from seven tissue-specific cDNA libraries spanning its length. The expressed sequence tags (ESTs) within each library were clustered to reduce clone redundancy and obtain longer consensus sequences. BLASTN and BLASTX searches against the NCBI human RefSeq databases were used to find putative matches for the bovine sequences and gene ontology assignments were made. Notable similarities and differences in gene expression were observed among the various compartments of the GI tract of the bovine. Many of the prominent transcripts have yet to be reliably identified and the prominence of others may be worthy of further examination. This collection of ESTs represents an important resource for the future construction of a GI tract specific microarray for further gene expression studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Genome

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The initiation of bud and hyphal growth in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans both involve polarized morphogenesis. However, there are many differences including the function of the septin proteins, a family of proteins involved in membrane organization in a wide range of organisms. Septins form a characteristic ring on the inner surface of the plasma membrane at the bud neck, whereas the septins are diffusely localized across emerging hyphal tips. In addition, septin rings are maintained at sites of septum formation in hyphae rather than being disassembled immediately after cytokinesis. The possibility that C. albicans septins are regulated by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO was examined in this study because the Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins were shown previously to be modified by SUMO (Smt3p). However, SUMO conjugation to septins was not detected during budding or hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. These results are supported by the lack of conserved SUMO consensus motifs between septins from the two organisms even after adjusting the predicted Cdc3p and Cdc12p septin sequences to account for mRNA splicing in C. albicans. Interestingly, a homolog of the Smt3p SUMO was identified in the C. albicans genome, and an epitope tagged version of Smt3p was conjugated to a variety of proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis showed prominent Smt3p SUMO localization at bud necks and sites of septum formation in hyphae similar to the septins. However, Smt3p was primarily detected on the mother cell side of the septin ring. A subset of these Smt3p-modified proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the septin Cdc11p. These results indicate that septin-associated proteins and not the septins themselves are the key target of SUMO modification at the bud neck in C. albicans.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The

Using in vitro studies of dual-import into mitochondria and chloroplasts as well as transient expression of fluorescence-labeled polypeptides, it could be clearly demonstrated that this VDAC isoform targets exclusively to mitochondria and not to plastids.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources by Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the Snf1p kinase and the Cat8p transcriptional activator, which binds to carbon source-responsive elements of target genes. We demonstrate that KlSnf1p and KlCat8p from K. lactis interact in a two-hybrid system and that the interaction is stronger with a kinase-dead mutant form of KlSnf1p. Of two putative phosphorylation sites in the KlCat8p sequence, serine 661 was identified as a key residue governing KlCat8p regulation. Serine 661 is located in the middle homology region, a regulatory domain conserved among zinc cluster transcription factors, and is part of an Snf1p consensus phosphorylation site. Single mutations at this site are sufficient to completely change the carbon source regulation of the KlCat8p transactivation activity observed. A serine-to-glutamate mutant form mimicking constitutive phosphorylation results in a nearly constitutively active form of KlCat8p, while a serine-to-alanine mutation has the reverse effect. Furthermore, it is shown that KlCat8p phosphorylation depends on KlSNF1. The Snf1-Cat8 connection is evolutionarily conserved: mutation of corresponding serine 562 of ScCat8p gave similar results in S. cerevisiae. The enhanced capacity of ScCat8S562E to suppress the phenotype caused by snf1 strengthens the hypothesis of direct phosphorylation of Cat8p by Snf1p. Unlike that of S. cerevisiae ScCAT8, KlCAT8 transcription is not carbon source regulated, illustrating the prominent role of posttranscriptional regulation of Cat8p in K. lactis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular and cellular

Although the brain is not the major Pb and Hg depot in the body, these metals preferentially accumulate in astroglia to exert toxic effects. In this study, we examined the effects of Pb acetate and HgCl(2) on the expression of GRP78, a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that may provide cytoprotection in response to cellular stresses in the C6 rat glioma cell line. We also evaluated the DNA binding activities of several redox-regulated transcription factors in metal-treated cells. Our results showed that mRNA levels of GRP78 were up-regulated by Pb and Hg at 0.1 and 1 micro M, but down-regulated at higher concentrations (10 micro M). GRP78 protein levels increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in Pb and/or Hg-treated cells. Pb increased protein binding to the GST- Upsilon a antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE/EpRE) and to the NF- kappaB consensus binding sequence of the cytomegalovirus 2 (CMB2) promoter, but decreased protein binding to the Ha-ras ARE/EpRE or to the c-fos 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response element (TRE). In contrast, Hg activated DNA binding by all redox-regulated transcription factors. These studies shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of Pb and Hg toxicity in C6 rat glioma cells and suggest that GRP78 and oxidative stress may participate in the neurotoxic response to these metals.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Neurotoxicity

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The mechanism of action of retinoic acid (RA) is of broad relevance to cell and developmental biology, nutrition, and cancer chemotherapy. RA is known to induce expression of the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1) gene which propels RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, motivating the present analysis of transcriptional regulation of blr1 expression by RA. The RA-treated HL-60 cells used here expressed all RA receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) subtypes (as detected by Northern analysis) except RXRgamma. Treatment with RAR- and RXR-selective ligands showed that RARalpha synergized with RXRalpha to transcriptionally activate blr1 expression. A 5'-flanking region capable of supporting RA-induced blr1 activation in HL-60 cells was found to contain a 205-bp sequence in the distal portion that was necessary for transcriptional activation by RA. Within this sequence DNase I footprinting revealed that RA induced binding of a nuclear protein complex to an element containing two GT boxes. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and supershift assays showed that this element bound recombinant RARalpha and RXRalpha. Without RA there was neither complex binding nor transcriptional activation. Both GT boxes were needed for binding the complex, and mutation of either GT box caused the loss of transcriptional activation by RA. The ability of this cis-acting RAR-RXR binding element to activate transcription in response to RA also depended on downstream sequences where an octamer transcription factor 1 (Oct1) site and a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) site between this element and the transcriptional start, as well as a cyclic AMP response element binding factor (CREB) site between the transcriptional start and first exon of the blr1 gene, were necessary. Each of these sites bound its corresponding transcription factor. A transcription factor-transcription factor binding array analysis of nuclear lysate from RA-treated cells indicated several prominent RARalpha binding partners; among these, Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 were identified by competition EMSA and supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as components of the complex. RA upregulated expression of these three factors. In sum the results of the present study indicate that RA-induced expression of blr1 expression depends on a novel RA response element. This cis-acting element approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start consists of two GT boxes that bind RAR and RXR in a nuclear protein complex that also contains Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 bound to their cognate downstream consensus binding sites.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Molecular and cellular
