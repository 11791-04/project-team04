A bespoke site design was formulated to include open plan workspace, natural lighting, ventilation, significant plants, prospect and views, recycled materials and use of non-synthetic materials. Initial data in the first three months was gathered from a series of demographic questions and from interviews and observations of site workers. Preliminary data indicates a strong positive effect from incorporating aspects of biophilic design to boost productivity, ameliorate stress, enhance well-being, foster a collaborative work environment and promote workplace satisfaction, thus contributing towards a high performance workspace. The longitudinal study spanning over two years will track human-plant interactions in a biophilic influenced space, whilst also assessing the concomitant cognitive, social, psychological and physical health benefits for workers.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Physics","uri":{"id":"D006283","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Benefits","uri":{"id":"D007342","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Australia","uri":{"id":"D001315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cooperative Behavior","uri":{"id":"D003299","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Foster Home Care","uri":{"id":"D005581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lighting","uri":{"id":"D008029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventilators, Mechanical","uri":{"id":"D012122","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Track and Field","uri":{"id":"D014142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventilation","uri":{"id":"D014691","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workplace","uri":{"id":"D017132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Satisfaction","uri":{"id":"D010549","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431874","title":"Are Biophilic-Designed Site Office Buildings Linked to Health Benefits and High Performing Occupants?","year":"2014"}

Mediating variables included nurse work characteristics of workload, social capital, decision latitude, as well as work engagement dimensions of vigor, dedication and absorption. Background: Understanding how to support and guide nurse practice communities in their daily effort to answer complex care most accurate, alongside with the demand of a stable and healthy nurse workforce, is challenging. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Method: Based on earlier empirical findings, a structural equation model, designed with valid measurement instruments, was tested. The study population included registered acute care hospital nurses (N = 1201) in eight hospitals across Belgium. Results: Nurse practice environment dimensions predicted nurses' ratings of job outcome variables as well as quality of care. Features of nurses' work characteristics, e.g., perceived workload, decision latitude, social capital, and the three dimension of work engagement, played mediating roles between nurse practice environment and outcomes. A revised model, using various fit measures, explained 60% of job outcomes and 47% of nurse-assessed quality of care. Conclusion: The findings in this study show that nurse work characteristics as workload, decision latitude, and social capital, alongside with nurse work engagement (e.g., vigor, dedication, and absorption) influence nurses' perspective of their nurse practice environment, job outcomes, and quality of care. The results underline aspects to considerate for various stakeholders, such as executives, nurse managers, physicians, and staff nurses, in setting up and organizing health care services.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in psychology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Structural","uri":{"id":"D008961","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Services","uri":{"id":"D006296","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Care","uri":{"id":"D009732","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Registries","uri":{"id":"D012042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Sectional Studies","uri":{"id":"D003430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurse Administrators","uri":{"id":"D009718","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Staff","uri":{"id":"D009740","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing, Practical","uri":{"id":"D009743","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anniversaries and Special Events","uri":{"id":"D000846","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Economics","uri":{"id":"D004467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workload","uri":{"id":"D016526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Belgium","uri":{"id":"D001530","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431563","title":"Nurse work engagement impacts job outcome and nurse-assessed quality of care: model testing with nurse practice environment and nurse work characteristics as predictors.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Skin wound healing is a complex process involving many types of cells and molecules and often results in scar tissue formation in adult mammals. However, scarless healing occurs in fetal skin and minimal scars may occur after cutaneous healing in the adult with reduced inflammation. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is widely distributed within the central nervous system and in other body regions, such as the skin, and has strong anti-inflammatory activity. The aim in the present experiments was to learn if intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of α-MSH just before skin wounds antagonize inflammation and improves skin wound healing in adult mice. C57BL/6 young-adult mice received an i.p. injection of 1 mg/kg of α-MSH and, 30 minutes later, two circular through-and-through holes (6,5 mm diameter) were made in their dorsal skin under anesthesia. Control mice were wounded after vehicle injection. The wound healing process was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically at 3, 7, 40 and 60 days. Skin samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5μm, stained with H&E or toluidine blue for cell analysis or Gomori's trichome for extracellular matrix (ECM) analysis. Other samples were fixed in DMSO+methanol, embedded in paraplast and incubated with anti-CD45, anti-smooth muscle actin, anti-collagen-I and anti-collagen-III for immunofluorescence analysis. Alpha-MSH significantly reduced the number of leukocytes, mast cells and fibroblasts at 3 and 7 days after injury. On days 40 and 60, α-MSH reduced scar area and improved the organization of the collagen fibers indicating that it may direct the healing into a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway.

It is crucial to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and improve the success of endocrine therapies. Splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1) mutations are described in luminal breast cancer albeit in low frequency. In this study, we evaluated the role of SF3B1 and SF3B3, critical parts of the SF3b splicing complex, in ER-positive endocrine resistance. To ascertain the role of SF3B1/SF3B3 in endocrine resistance, their expression levels were evaluated in ER-positive/endocrine-resistant cell lines (MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9) using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To further determine their clinical relevance, expression analysis was performed in a cohort of 60 paraffin-embedded ER-positive, node-negative breast carcinomas with low, intermediate, and high Oncotype DX recurrence scores. Expression levels of SF3B1 and SF3B3 and their prognostic value were validated in large cohorts using publicly available gene expression data sets including The Cancer Genome Atlas. SF3B1 and SF3B3 levels were significantly increased in ERα-positive cells with acquired tamoxifen (MCF-7/LCC2; both P<0.0002) and fulvestrant/tamoxifen resistance (MCF-7/LCC9; P=0.008 for SF3B1 and P=0.0006 for SF3B3). Expression levels of both MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9 were not affected by additional treatments with E2 and/or tamoxifen. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that SF3B3 expression is significantly upregulated in Oncotype DX high-risk groups when compared with low risk (P=0.019). Similarly, in publicly available breast cancer gene expression data sets, overexpression of SF3B3, but not SF3B1, was significantly correlated with overall survival. Furthermore, the correlation was significant in ER-positive, but not in ER-negative tumors.This is the first study to document the role of SF3B3 in endocrine resistance and prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer.

Considering that diabetic rats and mice present higher depressive-like behaviour when submitted to the forced swimming test and that treatment with insulin and/or clonazepam is able to reverse the behavioural changes of the diabetic rats, the present work investigated the antioxidant status, specifically total antioxidant reactivity and antioxidant potential of insulin and clonazepam, as well as the effect of this drugs upon protein oxidative damage and reactive species formation in cortex, hippocampus and striatum from diabetic rats submitted to forced swimming test. It was verified that longer immobility time in diabetic rats and insulin plus clonazepam treatment reversed this depressive-like behaviour. Moreover, data obtained in this study allowed to demonstrate through different parameters such as protein carbonyl content, 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase assay, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential and total antioxidant reactivity that there is oxidative stress in cortex, hippocampus and striatum from diabetic rats under depressive-like behaviour and highlight the insulin and/or clonazepam effect in these different brain areas, restoring antioxidant status and protein damage.

However, long-chain RNA analysis is restricted in FFPE tissues due to high levels of degradation. To explore the possibility of long RNA quantification in FFPE tissues, we selected 14 target RNAs (8 mRNAs and 6 long noncoding RNAs) from literatures, and designed short (~60 bp) and long (~200 bp) amplicons for each of them. Colorectal carcinomas with adjacent normal tissues were subjected to quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (quantitative RT-PCR) in 3 cohorts, including 18 snap-frozen and 83 FFPE tissues. We found that short amplicons were amplified more efficiently than long amplicons both in snap-frozen (P = 0.0006) and FFPE (P = 0.0152) tissues. Nonetheless, comparison of colorectal carcinomas with their adjacent normal tissues demonstrated that the consistency of fold-change trends in a single short amplicon between snap-frozen and FFPE tissues was only 36%. Therefore, we innovatively performed quantitative RT-PCR with 3 non-overlapping short amplicons for 14 target RNAs in FFPE tissues. All target RNAs showed a concordance of 100% of fold-change trends in at least two short amplicons, which offers sufficient information for accurate quantification of target RNAs. Our findings demonstrated the possibility of long-chain RNA analysis with 3 non-overlapping short amplicons in standardized-preserved FFPE tissues.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Scientific reports","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Colorectal Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D015179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biomedical Research","uri":{"id":"D035843","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430878","title":"Quantitative assessment of short amplicons in FFPE-derived long-chain RNA.","year":"2014"}

BACKGROUND: Nurse faculty play key roles in preparing new nurses and graduate nurses. However, educational institutions are challenged to maintain full employment in faculty positions. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey design was employed. METHODS: Ontario nurse faculty were asked to select, from a list, work characteristics that entice them to remain in or leave their faculty positions. Respondent data (n = 650) were collected using mailed surveys over four months in 2011. RESULTS: While preferred work characteristics differed across generations, the most frequently selected incentives enticing nurse faculty to stay were having: a supportive director/dean, reasonable workloads, supportive colleagues, adequate resources, manageable class sizes and work/life balance. The most frequently selected disincentives included: unmanageable workloads, unsupportive organizations, poor work environments, exposure to bullying, belittling and other types of incivility in the workplace and having an unsupportive director/dean. CONCLUSION: This research yields new and important knowledge about work characteristics that nurse faculty report shape their decisions to remain in or leave their current employment. Certain work characteristics were rated as important among all generations. Where similarities exist, broad strategies addressing work characteristics may effectively promote nurse faculty retention. However, where generational differences exist, retention-promoting strategies should target generation-specific preferences.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of advanced nursing","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Sectional Studies","uri":{"id":"D003430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Faculty, Nursing","uri":{"id":"D005181","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Family Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D005191","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Motivation","uri":{"id":"D009042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ontario","uri":{"id":"D009864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Postal Service","uri":{"id":"D011177","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workload","uri":{"id":"D016526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workplace","uri":{"id":"D017132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Faculty","uri":{"id":"D005178","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bullying","uri":{"id":"D058445","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430800","title":"Generation-specific incentives and disincentives for nurse faculty to remain employed.","year":"2014"}

BACKGROUND: Hiring temporary nurses raises controversial issues with respect to nurse staffing, care processes and patient outcomes, yet empirical findings regarding the use of temporary nurses are mixed. Whether adverse patient outcomes in intensive care units are related to the use of temporary nursing staff remains unexamined. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal design was used. METHODS: Data were collected monthly from 12 intensive care units at six hospitals; 144 ICU-month data points were used for the analysis. Chi-square, anova and logit regression models were used to examine the research questions. RESULTS: The intensive care units used higher levels of temporary nursing staff, but the use of temporary nursing staff was not significantly associated with nosocomial infections. Nurses' perceptions regarding staffing and resource adequacy were significantly associated with nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to link the use of temporary nursing staff and nosocomial infections. Instead, nurses' perceptions of staffing adequacy were related to nosocomial infections. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Given the greater use of temporary nursing staff in intensive care units, nurse managers in intensive care units need to monitor the levels of temporary nurse staffing and develop a systematic approach for hospitals to assist in these nurses' adjustment, which can reduce the burden of both temporary and permanent intensive care unit nurses. In addition to quantitative measures of nurse staffing, nurses' perceptions regarding staffing adequacy can be used to measure nurse staffing in relation to adverse patient outcomes.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical nursing","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Care","uri":{"id":"D009732","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Critical Care Nursing","uri":{"id":"D064648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intensive Care Units","uri":{"id":"D007362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intensive Care","uri":{"id":"D017055","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross Infection","uri":{"id":"D003428","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurse Administrators","uri":{"id":"D009718","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Staff","uri":{"id":"D009740","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated","uri":{"id":"D053717","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perception","uri":{"id":"D010465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pneumonia","uri":{"id":"D011014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rivers","uri":{"id":"D045483","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430655","title":"Use of temporary nursing staff and nosocomial infections in intensive care units.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"AIMS: Mutation detection accuracy has been described extensively; however, it is surprising that pre-PCR processing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples has not been systematically assessed in clinical context. We designed a RING trial to (i) investigate pre-PCR variability, (ii) correlate pre-PCR variation with EGFR/BRAF mutation testing accuracy and (iii) investigate causes for observed variation. METHODS: 13 molecular pathology laboratories were recruited. 104 blinded FFPE curls including engineered FFPE curls, cell-negative FFPE curls and control FFPE tissue samples were distributed to participants for pre-PCR processing and mutation detection. Follow-up analysis was performed to assess sample purity, DNA integrity and DNA quantitation. RESULTS: Rate of mutation detection failure was 11.9%. Of these failures, 80% were attributed to pre-PCR error. Significant differences in DNA yields across all samples were seen using analysis of variance (p<0.0001), and yield variation from engineered samples was not significant (p=0.3782). Two laboratories failed DNA extraction from samples that may be attributed to operator error. DNA extraction protocols themselves were not found to contribute significant variation. 10/13 labs reported yields averaging 235.8 ng (95% CI 90.7 to 380.9) from cell-negative samples, which was attributed to issues with spectrophotometry. DNA measurements using Qubit Fluorometry demonstrated a median fivefold overestimation of DNA quantity by Nanodrop Spectrophotometry. DNA integrity and PCR inhibition were factors not found to contribute significant variation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide evidence demonstrating that variation in pre-PCR steps is prevalent and may detrimentally affect the patient's ability to receive critical therapy. We provide recommendations for preanalytical workflow optimisation that may reduce errors in down-stream sequencing and for next-generation sequencing library generation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical pathology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Analysis of Variance","uri":{"id":"D000704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation Rate","uri":{"id":"D059645","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Analysis of Variance","uri":{"id":"D000704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Observer Variation","uri":{"id":"D015588","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathology, Molecular","uri":{"id":"D057089","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Laboratories","uri":{"id":"D007753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Libraries","uri":{"id":"D007990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathology","uri":{"id":"D010336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrophotometry","uri":{"id":"D013053","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workflow","uri":{"id":"D057188","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fluorometry","uri":{"id":"D005470","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430497","title":"Variation in pre-PCR processing of FFPE samples leads to discrepancies in BRAF and EGFR mutation detection: a diagnostic RING trial.","year":"2014"}

To solve the above-mentioned problems, this paper presents a new alternating integrator. In the new integrator, the integrator system of real-time drift compensation is adopted as one integral cell while two such integral cells work alternately. To achieve the alternate function, a Field Programmable Gate Array built in the digitizer is utilized.

The geometrical efficiency of SDDs is limited by the size of commercially available crystals, which is often smaller than the dimension of neutron beams along collimated lines of sight in tokamak devices. In this work, we present the design and fabrication of a 14 MeV neutron spectrometer consisting of 12 diamond pixels arranged in a matrix, so to achieve an improved geometrical efficiency. Each pixel is equipped with an independent high voltage supply and read-out electronics optimized to combine high energy resolution and fast signals (<30 ns), which are essential to enable high counting rate (>1 MHz) spectroscopy. The response function of a prototype SDD to 14 MeV neutrons has been measured at the Frascati Neutron Generator by observation of the 8.3 MeV peak from the (12)C(n, α)(9)Be reaction occurring between neutrons and (12)C nuclei in the detector.

To verify the viability and accuracy of the established system, thermal strains of a chromiumnickel austenite stainless steel sample heated from room temperature up to 600 °C were determined. The preliminary results indicate that the air disturbance between the camera and the specimen due to heat haze induces apparent distortions in the recorded images and large errors in the measured strains, but the average values of the measured strains are accurate enough.

A key component of this work is the predictive identification of relative skin sensitizing potency, achieved normally by the measurement of the threshold (the \"EC3\" value) in the local lymph node assay (LLNA). In an extended series of studies, the accuracy of this murine induction threshold as the predictor of the absence of a sensitizing effect has been verified by conduct of a human repeated insult patch test (HRIPT). Murine and human thresholds for a diverse set of 57 fragrance chemicals spanning approximately four orders of magnitude variation in potency have been compared. The results confirm that there is a useful correlation, with the LLNA EC3 value helping particularly to identify stronger sensitizers. Good correlation (with half an order of magnitude) was seen with three-quarters of the dataset. The analysis also helps to identify potential outlier types of (fragrance) chemistry, exemplified by hexyl and benzyl salicylates (an over-prediction) and trans-2-hexenal (an under-prediction).","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cutaneous and ocular toxicology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph Nodes","uri":{"id":"D008198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Assessment","uri":{"id":"D018570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Experimentation","uri":{"id":"D006805","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patch Tests","uri":{"id":"D010328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Local Lymph Node Assay","uri":{"id":"D023441","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chemistry","uri":{"id":"D002621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hypersensitivity","uri":{"id":"D006967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph","uri":{"id":"D008196","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Salicylates","uri":{"id":"D012459","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Local Lymph Node Assay","uri":{"id":"D023441","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430073","title":"Correlation between experimental human and murine skin sensitization induction thresholds.","year":"2014"}

It is observed that the nanoparticle contact (bridging) aggregation is formed when the nanoparticle-monomer attraction strength is relatively weak (large) in comb PNCs. The organization states of aggregation for the moderate nanoparticle-monomer attraction strength can be well suppressed by the comb polymer architecture, while the bridging structure for relatively large attraction is obviously promoted. With the increase of the particle volume fraction, the organization states of bridging-type structure become stronger and tighter; however, this effect is weaker than that of the nanoparticle-monomer attraction strength. When the particle volume fraction and moderate nanoparticle-monomer attraction strength are fixed, the effects of degree of polymerization, side chain number, side chain length, and nanoparticle-monomer size ratio on the organization states of PNC melts are not prominent and the nanoparticles can well disperse in comb polymer.

This will involve developing a clear definition of context by describing its features, domains and defining characteristics. BACKGROUND: The context where clinical care is delivered influences that care. While research shows that context is important to knowledge translation (implementation), we lack conceptual clarity on what is context, which contextual factors probably modify the effect of knowledge translation interventions (and hence should be considered when designing interventions) and which contextual factors themselves could be targeted as part of a knowledge translation intervention (context modification). DESIGN: Concept analysis. METHODS: The Walker and Avant concept analysis method, comprised of eight systematic steps, will be used: (1) concept selection; (2) determination of aims; (3) identification of uses of context; (4) determination of defining attributes of context; (5) identification/construction of a model case of context; (6) identification/construction of additional cases of context; (7) identification/construction of antecedents and consequences of context; and (8) definition of empirical referents of context. This study is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (January 2014).

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: The survival and life expectancy rates of people with traumatic and degenerative neurological conditions are increasing, sometimes up to several decades. Yet compared to the general population, people with a disability continue to experience poorer health and are at greater risk of developing secondary health problems and facing barriers to services they require. These trends have significant implications for provision of health and rehabilitation services. In this study, the adequacy of health and rehabilitation services provided to people with long-term neurological conditions and their unmet needs were explored from the perspectives of individual users, their nominated family members and key service providers. A qualitative research design with maximum variation sampling was used. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews with 65 participants comprising 25 long-term care service users, nominated family members or friends (n = 22) and care service providers (n = 18) in Queensland, Australia. All service users needed assistance with usual daily activities, and 22 were wheelchair dependent. The hours of funded personal care ranged from 2 to 201 hours per week. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Participants generally perceived that specialist medical and hospital services were adequate and satisfactory. They valued supportive health and rehabilitation professionals and receiving client-centred physical rehabilitation. However, the majority of participants (n = 17) had perceived unmet needs for physical rehabilitation (n = 14), other health or rehabilitation services (n = 10) or counselling (n = 6). Community-based physical maintenance rehabilitation was often perceived as inadequate, costly or inconveniently located.

Thus, there is an emergent need to invest a novel therapeutic for EOC. In this study, we defined ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) as a therapeutic target for EOC. Western blot was used to evaluate the expression of USP14 in nine fresh EOC tissues and three fresh normal ovarian tissues. The protein level of USP14 was higher in the cancer samples compared with that in the normal ovary tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded section of 116 cases of EOCs and indicated that USP14 was significantly associated with clinical pathologic variables. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that high expression of USP14 was related to poor prognosis of EOC patients. Starvation and re-feeding assay was used to imitate cell cycle, suggesting that USP14 played a critical role in SKOV3 cell proliferation. CCK-8 assay showed that SKOV3 cells treated with USP14-shRNA (shUSP14) grew more slowly than control group. Flow cytometry revealed that the reduced expression of USP14 induced the apoptosis of the SKOV3 EOC cells. In summary, our findings suggest that USP14 is involved in the progression of EOC and that it may be a useful target of therapy in EOC.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Cycle","uri":{"id":"D002453","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Flow Cytometry","uri":{"id":"D005434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ovarian Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D010051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases","uri":{"id":"D064570","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ovary","uri":{"id":"D010053","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptide Hydrolases","uri":{"id":"D010447","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Apoptosis","uri":{"id":"D017209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sincalide","uri":{"id":"D012844","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Starvation","uri":{"id":"D013217","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429837","title":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) regulates cellular proliferation and apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.","year":"2015"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic thoracic pain after cardiac surgery is prevalent (11 to 56%) and may affect patients' physical and mental health status. Despite its favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, high doses of remifentanil administered during surgery are reported to cause acute postoperative pain and increased requirements for analgesics. Recently, an association between remifentanil use and the incidence of chronic thoracic pain in the long term was also reported. Our objective is to investigate the influence of the intraoperative remifentanil on chronic postoperative pain in a prospective randomized controlled trial.Methods/design: In this prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, all patients (N =126) between 18 and 85 years undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy receive a continuous infusion of propofol together with intermittent intravenous fentanyl at predetermined times perioperatively. Patients are randomized to receive either an additional continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.15 mug-1kgIBW-1 min-1) or additional fentanyl (200 to 500 mug) as needed during surgery.The primary end point is the prevalence of chronic thoracic pain 12 months after surgery. Secondary end points include acute postoperative pain; postoperative analgesic use; chronic thoracic pain 3 and 6 months after surgery; quality of life (SF-12) at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery; work productivity; and use of health care. In addition, thermal detection and pain thresholds are measured preoperatively, 3 days after surgery and 12 months after surgery using quantitative sensory testing (QST). Finally, the influence of several genetic variances on the different outcomes will be measured. DISCUSSION: Chronic thoracic pain is prevalent after cardiac surgery, and research is needed to minimize the risk of chronic persistent postoperative pain, which is an invalidating, long-term complication of surgery. The objective of this trial is to determine the influence of perioperative remifentanil on long-term pain outcomes for cardiac patients in a prospective randomized trial. The results may be used to optimize perioperative analgesia techniques and, thereby, improve quality of life after cardiac surgery.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02031016 on 13 December

To overcome the difficulties intrinsic to crack length monitoring during its propagation an equivalent crack method was employed as data reduction scheme. The proposed method was validated numerically by means of a finite element analysis including a cohesive zone modeling and subsequently applied to experimental results to determine the fracture energy of bone under pure mode II loading. Finally, a cohesive law representative of fracture behavior of each specimen was determined employing an inverse method, considering a trapezoidal shape for the softening law. The consistency of the obtained results leads to the conclusion that the trapezoidal law is adequate to simulate fracture behavior of bone under mode II loading. The proposed testing setup and the employed data reduction scheme constitute powerful tools in which concerns fracture characterization of bone under pure mode II loading and can be viewed as the main outcomes of this work.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Materials science & engineering.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term functional outcomes of ankles following biological open Achilles tendon repair and early postoperative mobilization. METHODS: The study retrospectively evaluated 22 male patients who underwent one-sided biological open Achilles tendon repair. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, isokinetic muscle strength and endurance tests and active angle reproduction test at 15° of dorsiflexion and 20° of plantarflexion of the injured and uninjured sides were measured and compared. RESULTS: Mean age was 38.6 years and mean follow-up was 33.7 months. One patient had rerupture following a blunt trauma 1 month after operation. No other complication was seen. Mean AOFAS hindfoot score was 97.9 (range: 90 to 100). Peak isokinetic torque at 30°/sec (isokinetic muscle strength) and total work at 120°/sec (isokinetic muscle endurance) did not significantly differ between the operated and uninjured ankles. Proprioceptive evaluation with active angle reproduction test at 15°of dorsiflexion and 20° of plantarflexion was similar between the two sides. CONCLUSION: Biological open Achilles tendon repair with early postoperative mobilization appears to be a convenient intervention for acute Achilles tendon rupture in active young patients. Treatment results in low complication rates and restores ankle strength, endurance and position sense.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Early Ambulation","uri":{"id":"D004434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retrospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D012189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Achilles Tendon","uri":{"id":"D000125","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proprioception","uri":{"id":"D011434","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscle Strength","uri":{"id":"D053580","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ankle","uri":{"id":"D000842","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tendons","uri":{"id":"D013710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Torque","uri":{"id":"D019415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tendinopathy","uri":{"id":"D052256","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rupture","uri":{"id":"D012421","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429584","title":"Functional outcomes of repair of Achilles tendon using a biological open surgical method.","year":"2014"}

The World Health Organization estimates that one-third of the world population is infected and some epidemiologic factors related to the transmission have been identified. The purpose of this investigation was to study the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in people living in the rural community of \"El Canal\", Consolación del Sur municipality and the association with some epidemiologic risk factors. All participants were subjected to three methods of parasitological examinations on the stool samples and by immunodiagnostic tests which allow the detection of excretory-secretory antigens of adults with F hepatica. The global prevalence rate of intestinal parasitic infections was 18%, and 16.7% for protozoan infections, while the rate of helminth infection was lower (5.3%) in the population studied. The univariate analysis identified three factors associated with intestinal pathogenic protozoan infections which include livestock work, drinking water from well\\river and eating unwashed fruits\\vegetables. The multivariate analysis using introduction test logistic regression ratified the association of these risk factors. Contrary to what have been published in the majority of Cuban studies carried out in rural places, a higher prevalence of protozoa than helminthic infection was found.

However, these identified variants only explain a small fraction of inheritable variability in many diseases, suggesting that other resources, such as multilevel genetic variations, may contribute to disease susceptibility. In this work, we proposed to combine genetic variants that belong to a gene set, such as at gene- and pathway-level to form an integrated signal aimed to identify major players that function in a coordinated manner conferring disease risk. The integrated analysis provides novel insight into disease etiology while individual signals could be easily missed by single variant analysis. We applied our approach to a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with male and female data analyzed separately. Novel sex-specific genes and pathways were identified to increase the risk of T2D. We also demonstrated the performance of signal integration through simulation studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in genetics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genetic Variation","uri":{"id":"D014644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease Susceptibility","uri":{"id":"D004198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome-Wide Association Study","uri":{"id":"D055106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wills","uri":{"id":"D014918","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429300","title":"A set-based association test identifies sex-specific gene sets associated with type 2 diabetes.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: As electronic communication becomes increasingly common, and as students juggle study, work, and family life, many universities are offering their students more flexible learning opportunities. Classes once delivered face-to-face are often replaced by online activities and discussions. However, there is little research comparing students' experience and learning in these two modalities. The aim of this study was to compare undergraduates' preference for, and academic performance on, class material and assessment presented online vs. in traditional classrooms. Psychology students (N = 67) at an Australian university completed written exercises, a class discussion, and a written test on two academic topics. The activities for one topic were conducted face-to-face, and the other online, with topics counterbalanced across two groups. The results showed that students preferred to complete activities face-to-face rather than online, but there was no significant difference in their test performance in the two modalities. In their written responses, students expressed a strong preference for class discussions to be conducted face-to-face, reporting that they felt more engaged, and received more immediate feedback, than in online discussion. A follow-up study with a separate group (N = 37) confirmed that although students appreciated the convenience of completing written activities online in their own time, they also strongly preferred to discuss course content with peers in the classroom rather than online. It is concluded that online and face-to-face activities can lead to similar levels of academic performance, but that students would rather do written activities online but engage in discussion in person. Course developers could aim to structure classes so that students can benefit from both the flexibility of online learning, and the greater engagement experienced in face-to-face discussion.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in psychology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Follow-Up Studies","uri":{"id":"D005500","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electronics","uri":{"id":"D004581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrons","uri":{"id":"D004583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Feedback","uri":{"id":"D005246","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Learning","uri":{"id":"D007858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychology","uri":{"id":"D011584","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Students","uri":{"id":"D013334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise","uri":{"id":"D015444","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pliability","uri":{"id":"D018583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429276","title":"Face-to-face or face-to-screen?

Trained male (n=11, 31 yrs) and female (n=10, 26 yrs) cyclists performed an incremental cycle test to exhaustion to determine maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max; male = 61, female = 56 ml∙kg(-1)∙min(-1)). A randomized, single-blinded crossover design was used for two experimental days where subjects completed a 5-km cycling time trial breathing humidified compressed room air or HeO2 (21% O2: balance He). Subjects were instrumented with an esophageal balloon for the assessment of respiratory mechanics. During the time trial, we assessed HeO2's ability to alleviate mechanical ventilatory constraints in three ways: (i) expiratory flow limitation, (ii) utilization of ventilatory capacity and (iii) the work of breathing. We found that HeO2 significantly reduced the work of breathing, increased the size of the maximal flow volume envelope and reduced the fractional utilization of the maximal ventilatory capacity equally between men and women. The primary finding of this study was that inspiring HeO2 was associated with a statistically significant performance improvement of 0.7% (3.2 seconds) for males and 1.5% (8.1 seconds) for females (P < 0.05) however there were no sex-differences with respect to improvement in time trial performance (P > 0.05). Our results suggests that the extent of sex-based differences in airway anatomy, work of breathing and expiratory flow limitation are not great enough to differentially affect whole-body exercise performance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compressed Air","uri":{"id":"D058868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work of Breathing","uri":{"id":"D014939","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Respiratory Mechanics","uri":{"id":"D015656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Over Studies","uri":{"id":"D018592","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Compressed Air","uri":{"id":"D058868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophagitis","uri":{"id":"D004941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise","uri":{"id":"D015444","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anatomy","uri":{"id":"anatomy_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anatomy","uri":{"id":"D000715","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429095","title":"HELIOX BREATHING EQUALLY INFLUENCES RESPIRATORY MECHANICS AND CYCLING PERFORMANCE IN TRAINED MALES AND FEMALES.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Δ(9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most commonly analyzed cannabinoid in oral fluid (OF); however, its metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH) offers the advantage of documenting active consumption, as it is not detected in cannabis smoke. Analytical challenges such as low (ng/L) THCCOOH OF concentrations hampered routine OF THCCOOH monitoring. Presence of minor cannabinoids like cannabidiol and cannabinol offer the advantage of identifying recent cannabis intake. Published OF cannabinoids methods have limitations, including few analytes and lengthy derivatization. We developed and validated a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for THC, its metabolites, 11-hydroxy-THC and THCCOOH quantification, and other natural cannabinoids including tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabigerol (CBG) in 1 mL OF collected with the Quantisal device. After solid-phase extraction, chromatography was performed on a Selectra PFPP column with a 0.15% formic acid in water and acetonitrile gradient with a 0.5 mL/min flow rate. All analytes were monitored in positive mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) with multiple reaction monitoring. Limits of quantification were 15 ng/L THCCOOH and 0.2 µg/L for all other analytes. Linear ranges extended to 3750 ng/L THCCOOH, 100 µg/L THC, and 50 µg/L for all other analytes. Inter-day analytical recoveries (bias) and imprecision at low, mid, and high quality control (QC) concentrations were 88.7-107.3% and 2.3-6.7%, respectively (n = 20). Mean extraction efficiencies and matrix effects evaluated at low and high QC were 75.9-86.1% and 8.4-99.4%, respectively.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The occupational injury incident rate remains relatively high in the European Union. The case-crossover study gives a unique opportunity to study transient risk factors that normally would be very difficult to approach. Studies like this have been carried out in both America and Asia, but so far no relevant research has been conducted in Europe. METHOD: Case-crossover studies of occupational injuries were collected from PubMed and Embase and read through. Previous experiences concerning method, exposure and outcome, time-related measurements and construction of the questionnaire were taken into account in the preparation of a pilot study. Consequently, experiences from the pilot study were used to design the study protocol. Approximately 2000 patients with an occupational injury will be recruited from the emergency departments in Herning and Odense, Denmark. A standardised questionnaire will be used to collect basic demographic data and information on eight transient risk factors. Based on previous studies and knowledge on occupational injuries the transient risk factors we chose to examine were: time pressure, performing a task with a different method/using unaccustomed technique, change in working surroundings, using a phone, disagreement, feeling ill, being distracted and using malfunctioning machinery/tools or work material. Exposure time 'just before the injury' will be compared with two control periods, 'previous day at the same time of the injury' (pair match) and the previous work week (usual frequency). DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes a unique opportunity to calculate the effect of transient risk factors on occupational injuries in a European setting.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emergency Service, Hospital","uri":{"id":"D004636","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pilot Projects","uri":{"id":"D010865","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"European Union","uri":{"id":"D005062","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occupational Injuries","uri":{"id":"D060051","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Americas","uri":{"id":"D000569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Demography","uri":{"id":"D003710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emergencies","uri":{"id":"D004630","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emotions","uri":{"id":"D004644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe","uri":{"id":"D005060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occupations","uri":{"id":"D009790","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pressure","uri":{"id":"D011312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reading","uri":{"id":"D011932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"PubMed","uri":{"id":"D039781","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asia","uri":{"id":"D001208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Denmark","uri":{"id":"D003718","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428426","title":"A case-crossover study of transient risk factors influence on occupational injuries: a study protocol based on a review of previous studies.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Background: Normal aging is associated with a decline in cognitive abilities, particularly in the domains of psychomotor speed and executive functioning. However, 'aging,' per se, is not a cause of cognitive decline but rather a variable that likely captures multiple accumulating biological changes over time that collectively affect mental abilities. Recent work has focused on the role of cerebrovascular disease as one of the biological changes. In the current study, we examined whether lobar microbleeds - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal voids due to hemosiderin deposits secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. Previous studies that reported a relationship between the presence of lobar microbleeds and decreased cognitive abilities have been primarily cross-sectional. Here, we used a retrospective longitudinal design to examine whether the presence of lobar microbleeds is associated with the rate of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Methods: Participants came from an ongoing longitudinal community-based aging study, in which subjects are evaluated at 18-24 months intervals and received a full medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination at each of the follow-up visits. Gradient echo MRI scans were available on 197 non-demented participants (mean age: 84.15 ± 5.02 years). Microbleeds were rated visually on axial view and divided into subcortical (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and lobar (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobe) regions, and confirmed with coronal and sagittal views to exclude artifacts. Cognition was assessed with a neuropsychological battery, providing summary scores for memory, language, executive, and visuospatial abilities. Using general estimating equations (GEE), we compared cognition cross-sectionally between individuals with 2 or more (n = 11) and fewer than 2 (n = 186) lobar microbleeds and examined longitudinal cognitive change beginning 9.47 ± 3.13 years before the MRI scan. Results: Subjects with 2 or more lobar microbleeds had worse executive functioning at the visit closest to the MRI scan (β = -0.044; p < 0.001) and had a faster decline in executive function over time (β = -0.072; p = 0.012) than subjects with fewer than 2 lobar microbleeds. The two groups were similar in age at scan date, education, ethnicity, sex distribution, and cognitive performance at first visit. Conclusions: Lobar microbleeds, a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, are associated with an accelerated rate of executive function decline. The presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be an important source of cognitive decline in aging. Future work should examine how cerebral amyloid angiopathy interacts with neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 S.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Upregulator of cell proliferation 4 (URG4) has been implicated in the oncogenesis of certain cancers. However, the correlation between URG4 expression and clinicopathological significance in human cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated its expression and clinicopathological significance in cervical cancer patients. METHODS: URG4 expression was examined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting in normal cervical epithelial cells, cervical cancer cells, and eight matched pairs of cervical cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from the same patient. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine URG4 expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 167 cervical cancer patients (FIGO stages Ib1-IIa2). Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations between URG4 expression and prognostic and diagnostic factors. RESULTS: URG4 was significantly upregulated in the cervical cancer cell lines and tissues compared with the normal cells and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues. IHC revealed high URG4 expression in 59 out of the 167 (35.13%) cervical cancer specimens. Its expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.0001), tumour size (P = 0.012), T classification (P = 0.023), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) and vaginal involvement (P = 0.002). Patients with high URG4 expression, particularly those who received concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P < 0.0001), showed a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with the low expression of this protein. Multivariate analysis revealed that URG4 expression is an independent prognostic factor for cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that elevated URG4 protein expression is associated with a poor outcome in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. URG4 may be a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC cancer","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epithelial Cells","uri":{"id":"D004847","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph Nodes","uri":{"id":"D008198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disease-Free Survival","uri":{"id":"D018572","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Proliferation","uri":{"id":"D049109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D002583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph","uri":{"id":"D008196","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011878","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogenesis","uri":{"id":"D063646","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaginitis","uri":{"id":"D014627","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427922","title":"URG4 overexpression is correlated with cervical cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.","year":"2014"}

This study aims to evaluate whether CEACAM6 can serve as a tumor marker using AP11. We examined the expression of CEACAM6 with AP11 in 11 human carcinoma cell lines by flow cytometry and 439 human tissues including 282 tumor tissues and 157 normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. CEACAM6 epitope recognized by AP11 was well preserved in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. Adenocarcinomas of the stomach (86 %), colorectum (95 %), pancreas (100 %), and lung (83 %), urinary bladder (100 %), and mucinous ovarian tumors (88 %) had a high rate of CEACAM6 immunoreactivity. We observed a variable expression of CEACAM6 in hepatocellular carcinomas (35 %), squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (60 %), renal cell carcinomas (14 %), urothelial carcinomas (13 %), serous carcinomas of the ovary (17 %), and breast carcinomas (11 %). Small-cell carcinomas of the lung, prostatic adenocarcinomas, papillary thyroid carcinomas, malignant melanomas, giant cell tumors, and osteosarcomas were negative for CEACAM6. All normal tissues of various organs were negative for CEACAM6. In conclusion, CEACAM6 as detected by AP11, may serve as a marker for mucin-producing adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and ovary as well as non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, AP11 represents a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting CEACMA6-positive cancers.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Virchows Archiv : an international journal of

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. 250 health care workers attended an evaluation where self-reported and physical function were measured. Differences between groups (full sick leave, partial sick leave, not on sick leave/working) were analyzed for categorical data (Chi square exact test) and continuous variables (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests). Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine which factors were associated with being on sick leave. RESULTS: Participants on full sick leave had statistically significant poorer function compared to those working and the group on partial sick leave. Logistic regression showed that a reduced level of the physical dimension of SF-12 and a high lift test were significantly related to full sick leave (OR 0.86, p < 0.001) (OR 0.79, p = 0.002). The physical dimension of SF-12 was the only variable that was associated to partial sick leave (OR 0.91, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Health care workers on full sick leave due to MSDs have reduced function on self-reported and physically tested function, compared to those working despite MSDs, as well as when compared to those on partial sick leave. More knowledge about work ability in occupational sub-groups is needed.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of occupational rehabilitation","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chi-Square Distribution","uri":{"id":"D016009","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sick Leave","uri":{"id":"D018582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Sectional Studies","uri":{"id":"D003430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Regression Analysis","uri":{"id":"D012044","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sick Leave","uri":{"id":"D018582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Statistics, Nonparametric","uri":{"id":"D018709","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occupations","uri":{"id":"D009790","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Qi","uri":{"id":"D019413","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427674","title":"Self-Reported and Tested Function in Health Care Workers with Musculoskeletal Disorders on Full, Partial or Not on Sick Leave.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Probe-microphone testing was conducted in the laboratory as early as the 1940s (e.g., the classic work of Wiener and Ross, reported in 1946), however, it was not until the late 1970s that a \"dispenser friendly\" system was available for testing hearing aids in the real ear. In this case, the term \"dispenser friendly,\" is used somewhat loosely. The 1970s equipment that I'm referring to was first described in a paper that was presented by Earl Harford, Ph.D. in September of 1979 at the International Ear Clinics' Symposium in Minneapolis. At this meeting, Earl reported on his clinical experiences of testing hearing aids in the real ear using a miniature (by 1979 standards) Knowles microphone. The microphone was coupled to an interfacing impedance matching system (developed by David Preves, Ph.D., who at the time worked at Starkey Laboratories) which could be used with existing hearing aid analyzer systems (see Harford, 1980 for review of this early work). Unlike today's probe tube microphone systems, this early method of clinical real-ear measurement involved putting the entire microphone (about 4mm by 5mm by 2mm) in the ear canal down by the eardrum of the patient. If you think cerumen is a problem with probe-mic measurements today, you should have seen the condition of this microphone after a day's work! While this early instrumentation was a bit cumbersome, we quickly learned the advantages that probe-microphone measures provided in the fitting of hearing aids. We frequently ran into calibration and equalization problems, not to mention a yelp or two from the patient, but the resulting information was worth the trouble. Help soon arrived. In the early 1980s, the first computerized probe-tube microphone system, the Rastronics CCI-10 (developed in Denmark by Steen Rasmussen), entered the U.S. market (Nielsen and Rasmussen, 1984). This system had a silicone tube attached to the microphone (the transmission of sound through this tube was part of the calibration process), which eliminated the need to place the microphone itself in the ear canal. By early 1985, three or four different manufactures had introduced this new type of computerized probe-microphone equipment, and this hearing aid verification procedure became part of the standard protocol for many audiology clinics. At his time, the POGO (Prescription Of Gain and Output) and Libby 1/3 prescriptive fitting methods were at the peak of their popularity, and a revised NAL (National Acoustic Laboratories) procedure was just being introduced. All three of these methods were based on functional gain, but insertion gain easily could be substituted, and therefore, manufacturers included calculation of these prescriptive targets as part of the probe-microphone equipment software. Audiologists, frustrated with the tedious and unreliable functional gain procedure they had been using, soon developed a fascination with matching real-ear results to prescriptive targets on a computer monitor. In some ways, not a lot has changed since those early days of probe-microphone measurements. Most people who use this equipment simply run a gain curve for a couple inputs and see if it's close to prescriptive target-something that could be accomplished using the equipment from 1985. Contrary to the predictions of many, probe-mic measures have not become the \"standard hearing aid verification procedure.\" (Mueller and Strouse, 1995). There also has been little or no increase in the use of this equipment in recent years. In 1998, I reported on a survey that was conducted by The Hearing Journal regarding the use of probe-microphone measures (Mueller, 1998). We first looked at what percent of people dispensing hearing aids own (or have immediate access to) probe-microphone equipment. Our results showed that 23% of hearing instrument specialists and 75% of audiologists have this equipment. Among audiologists, ownership varied among work settings: 91% for hospitals/clinics, 73% for audiologists working for physicians, and 69% for audiologists in private practice. But more importantly, and a bit puzzling, was the finding that showed that nearly one half of the people who fit hearing aids and have access to this equipment, seldom or never use it. I doubt that the use rate of probe-microphone equipment has changed much in the last three years, and if anything, I suspect it has gone down. Why do I say that? As programmable hearing aids have become the standard fitting in many clinics, it is tempting to become enamoured with the simulated gain curves on the fitting screen, somehow believing that this is what really is happening in the real ear. Additionally, some dispensers have been told that you can't do reliable probe-mic testing with modern hearing aids-this of course is not true, and we'll address this issue in the Frequently Asked Questions portion of this paper. The infrequent use of probe-mic testing among dispensers is discouraging, and let's hope that probe-mic equipment does not suffer the fate of the rowing machine stored in your garage. A lot has changed over the years with the equipment itself, and there are also expanded clinical applications and procedures. We have new manufacturers, procedures, acronyms and noises. We have test procedures that allow us to accurately predict the output of a hearing aid in an infant's ear. We now have digital hearing aids, which provide us the opportunity to conduct real-ear measures of the effects of digital noise reduction, speech enhancement, adaptive feedback, expansion, and all the other features. Directional microphone hearing aids have grown in popularity and what better way to assess the real-ear directivity than with probe-mic measures? The array of assistive listening devices has expanded, and so has the role of the real-ear assessment of these products. And finally, with today's PC -based systems, we can program our hearing aids and simultaneously observe the resulting real-ear effects on the same fitting screen, or even conduct an automated target fitting using earcanal monitoring of the output. There have been a lot of changes, and we'll talk about all of them in this issue of Trends.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Trends in

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is an infrequent but serious complication of solid organ transplantation. Early detection and initiation of therapy may improve outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type as risk and prognostic factors for PTLD. METHODS: A review was undertaken to identify PTLD cases treated at our institution over the past 25 years. Logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards were used to model risk factors for PTLD and clinical outcomes in patients with PTLD. RESULTS: One hundred six cases of PTLD were identified with 1392 solid-organ transplant recipient controls. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegative status pretransplant (odds ratio [OR] = 7.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 3.83-15.1) and receipt of a nonkidney transplant were associated with an increased risk of PTLD. Being African American and receipt of a living-related kidney transplant were associated with a decreased risk of PTLD. The HLA-B40 group was a risk factor for PTLD in EBV-seronegative individuals (OR = 8.38, 95% CI = 2.18-32.3), whereas HLA-B8 was a risk factor for PTLD in EBV-seropositive individuals (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.52-7.09). Specific HLA types were not associated with graft failure or mortality after PTLD diagnosis. In PTLD patients, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, bone marrow involvement, T-cell PTLD, and age were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Human leukocyte antigen-B40 group and HLA-B8 were identified as novel susceptibility factors for PTLD in EBV-seropositive and EBV-seronegative individuals, respectively. Multicentered, large prospective studies of PTLD with correlative immunologic work are needed to test the significance of these observed associations.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Transplantation","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bone

Meantime, the elastic behavior of the obtuse-angle twin (OT) GaN nanowires was disclosed both by the in-situ SEM resonance technique and in-situ TEM tensile test for the first time. Our results showed that the average Young's modulus of these OT nanowires was greatly decreased to about 66 GPa and indicated no size dependence at the diameter ranging 98-171 nm. A quantitative explanation for this phenomenon is proposed based on the rules of mixtures in classical mechanics.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Background Remote Australian Aboriginal communities experience high rates of bacterial sexually transmissible infections (STI). A key strategy to reduce STIs is to increase testing in primary health care centres. The current study aimed to explore barriers to offering and conducting STI testing in this setting. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken as part of the STI in Remote communities, Improved and Enhanced Primary Health Care (STRIVE) project; a large cluster randomised controlled trial of a sexual health quality improvement program. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews in 22 participating health centres across four regions in northern and central Australia. Results: Participants identified barriers including Aboriginal cultural norms that require the separation of genders and traditional kinship systems that prevent some staff and patients from interacting, both of which were exacerbated by a lack of male staff. Other common barriers were concerns about client confidentiality (lack of private consulting space and living in small communities), staff capacity to offer testing impacted by the competing demands for staff time, and high staff turnover resulting in poor understanding of clinic systems. Many participants also expressed concerns about managing positive test results. To address some of these barriers, participants revealed informal strategies, such as team work, testing outside the clinic and using adult health checks. Conclusions: Results identify cultural, structural and health system issues as barriers to offering STI testing in remote communities, some of which were overcome through the creativity and enthusiasm of individuals rather than formal systems. Many of these barriers can be readily addressed through strengthening existing systems of cultural and clinical orientation and educating staff to view STI in a population health framework. However others, particularly issues in relation to culture, kinship ties and living in small communities, may require testing modalities that do not rely on direct contact with health staff or the clinic environment.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Sexual health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Improvement","uri":{"id":"D058996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oceanic Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044468","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reproductive Health","uri":{"id":"D060728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Australia","uri":{"id":"D001315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cluster Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidentiality","uri":{"id":"D003219","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Creativity","uri":{"id":"D003405","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25426563","title":"Barriers and facilitators of sexually transmissible infection testing in remote Australian Aboriginal communities: results from the Sexually Transmitted Infections in Remote Communities, Improved and Enhanced Primary Health Care (STRIVE) Study.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Children with and after cancer are found to have a decreased physical fitness, frequently resulting in decreased physical functioning. The gold standard test for assessing aerobic fitness, a component of physical fitness, is the respiratory gas analyses--based cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). However, equipment for gas analysis is often unavailable in local physical therapy centres and non--university hospitals. The Steep Ramp Test (SRT), is a cycle ergometer test with a fast increase in workload, a short duration, and does not require respiratory gas analysis equipment. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the results of the CPET and the SRT, in children with cancer, and to assess whether the SRT can be used for aerobic fitness assessment in clinical practice in this population. DESIGN: This study is a cross--sectional assessment using baseline data of a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study was performed in a hospital setting. POPULATION: Sixty--one children (mean age 12.9 years; 33 boys) with cancer were included in the analysis; 16 children were on non--intensive chemotherapy treatment, 45 were in the first year thereafter. METHODS: Participants performed both the SRT and the CPET on a cycle ergometer with respiratory gas analysis. Data of the two tests were compared and regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: CPET test results revealed a higher impact on the cardiovascular system, as shown by higher peak ventilation (47.8 versus 52.0 Litres per min) and peak heart rates (173 versus 191 beats per min), compared to the SRT. In addition, the test time was significantly longer (90 s versus 390 s). Yet, the primary outcome of the SRT (peak work rate) was able to reliably estimate the peak oxygen uptake of the CPET. CONCLUSION: The peak oxygen uptake was comparable between the SRT and the CPET, although the peak work rate was significantly higher during the SRT. This study showed that the SRT is a valid instrument to assess aerobic fitness in children with cancer. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The SRT is less time consuming and can be performed without gas analysis in a non--clinical setting, making it less demanding for children.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Rate","uri":{"id":"D006339","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals, University","uri":{"id":"D006785","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Regression Analysis","uri":{"id":"D012044","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiovascular System","uri":{"id":"D002319","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise Test","uri":{"id":"D005080","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physical Fitness","uri":{"id":"D010809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygen","uri":{"id":"D010100","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygenators","uri":{"id":"D010106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventilators, Mechanical","uri":{"id":"D012122","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ventilation","uri":{"id":"D014691","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise","uri":{"id":"D015444","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workload","uri":{"id":"D016526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Architectural Accessibility","uri":{"id":"D001107","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25426542","title":"Application of the steep ramp test for aerobic fitness testing in children with cancer.","year":"2014"}

Besides static circumstance, however in the real environment there are often dynamic changes and the peripheral visual ability in a dynamic environment (i.e., dynamic peripheral visual ability) is important for all people. So far, no work has reported whether there is a relationship between the dynamic peripheral visual ability and the alpha activity. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate their relationship. Sixty-two soccer players performed a newly designed peripheral vision task in which the visual stimuli were dynamic, while their EEG signals were recorded from Cz, O1, and O2 locations. The relationship between the dynamic peripheral visual performance and the alpha activity was examined by the percentage-bend correlation test. The results indicated no significant correlation between the dynamic peripheral visual performance and the alpha amplitudes in the eyes-open and eyes-closed resting condition. However, it was not the case for the alpha activity during the peripheral vision task: the dynamic peripheral visual performance showed significant positive inter-individual correlations with the amplitudes in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and the individual alpha band (IAB) during the peripheral vision task. A potential application of this finding is to improve the dynamic peripheral visual performance by up-regulating alpha activity using neuromodulation techniques.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in human neuroscience","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rest","uri":{"id":"D012146","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electroencephalography","uri":{"id":"D004569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Soccer","uri":{"id":"D012916","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurotransmitter Agents","uri":{"id":"D018377","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25426058","title":"Dynamic peripheral visual performance relates to alpha activity in soccer players.","year":"2014"}

In order to provide information useful for their species identification, we performed a morphological identification of several Mustelus specimens to select individuals unambiguously attributed to 1 of the 2 species, and assayed these with 3 new molecular tests. First, we developed and validated a mitochondrial DNA assay based on species-specific amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI). Second, a fragment analysis of 15 microsatellites cross-amplified from several triakid species was performed to identify diagnostic loci. Finally, a length difference was identified in the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and a diagnostic test based on its amplification was established. All the samples classified morphologically as M. mustelus and M. punctulatus showed a species-specific profile using all the 3 molecular tests. In addition, cross-amplification of microsatellites allowed identification of 9 highly polymorphic loci that will be useful for the study of the mating system and population differentiation of the 2 species.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of heredity","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electron Transport Complex IV","uri":{"id":"D003576","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA, Mitochondrial","uri":{"id":"D004272","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytochromes c","uri":{"id":"D045304","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electron Transport Complex IV","uri":{"id":"D003576","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnostic Tests, Routine","uri":{"id":"D003955","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mediterranean Sea","uri":{"id":"D008522","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Character","uri":{"id":"D002605","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytochromes","uri":{"id":"D003580","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxidoreductases","uri":{"id":"D010088","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Microsatellite Repeats","uri":{"id":"D018895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sharks","uri":{"id":"D012754","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Elasmobranchii","uri":{"id":"D018940","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425673","title":"New Molecular Tools for the Identification of 2 Endangered Smooth-Hound Sharks, Mustelus mustelus and Mustelus punctulatus.","year":"2014"}

These injuries are thought to be a dynamic interplay of multiple factors. A literature review reveals a knowledge gap in understanding context-specific patterns of nursing injuries. DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional descriptive research design, 58 rehabilitation nurses participated in this study. METHODS: Anonymous paper surveys were sent to all rehabilitation nursing personnel on the unit. FINDINGS: Six themes emerged: lack of time and help, patient acuity, ergonomics, body movement issues, knowledge deficit, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing input is critical in understanding and reducing context-specific work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Further research that includes nursing voices is advocated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Rehabilitation nursing injuries appear to be a complex interaction of multiple determinants; therefore, multifaceted solutions using a quality improvement lens are recommended to improve the working conditions on the units.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Design","uri":{"id":"D012107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Improvement","uri":{"id":"D058996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rehabilitation Nursing","uri":{"id":"D019145","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Acuity","uri":{"id":"D062072","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anonyms and Pseudonyms","uri":{"id":"D000851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rehabilitation","uri":{"id":"D012046","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Voice","uri":{"id":"D014831","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Engineering","uri":{"id":"D006804","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425040","title":"Understanding Work-related Musculoskeletal Injuries in Rehabilitation from a Nursing Perspective.","year":"2014"}

BioCreative IV GO annotation task aims to evaluate the performance of system that automatically assigns GO terms to genes based on the narrative sentences in biomedical literature. This article presents our work in this task as well as the experimental results after the competition. For the evidence sentence extraction subtask, we built a binary classifier to identify evidence sentences using reference distance estimator (RDE), a recently proposed semi-supervised learning method that learns new features from around 10 million unlabeled sentences, achieving an F1 of 19.3% in exact match and 32.5% in relaxed match. In the post-submission experiment, we obtained 22.1% and 35.7% F1 performance by incorporating bigram features in RDE learning. In both development and test sets, RDE-based method achieved over 20% relative improvement on F1 and AUC performance against classical supervised learning methods, e.g. support vector machine and logistic regression. For the GO term prediction subtask, we developed an information retrieval-based method to retrieve the GO term most relevant to each evidence sentence using a ranking function that combined cosine similarity and the frequency of GO terms in documents, and a filtering method based on high-level GO classes. The best performance of our submitted runs was 7.8% F1 and 22.2% hierarchy F1. We found that the incorporation of frequency information and hierarchy filtering substantially improved the performance. In the post-submission evaluation, we obtained a 10.6% F1 using a simpler setting. Overall, the experimental analysis showed our approaches were robust in both the two tasks.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Database : the journal of biological databases and curation","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge Management","uri":{"id":"D058436","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Sequence Annotation","uri":{"id":"D058977","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Information Management","uri":{"id":"D019451","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Support Vector Machines","uri":{"id":"D060388","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Ontology","uri":{"id":"D063990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Learning","uri":{"id":"D007858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Relaxation","uri":{"id":"D012063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Area Under Curve","uri":{"id":"D019540","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425037","title":"A robust data-driven approach for gene ontology annotation.","year":"2014"}

The purpose of this study was to reduce work-related musculoskeletal nursing injuries by 10% on the rehabilitation unit in a Midwestern hospital. DESIGN: Using a quality improvement and evidence-based practice lens, one group time-series design was employed. METHODS: Shift reports, interdisciplinary collaboration, self-study educational packets, and journal club sessions were implemented. FINDINGS: Results, although not statistically significant, indicated over a 50% reduction in work-related musculoskeletal nursing injuries. Self-engagement and the Hawthorne effect are thought to have contributed to this decline in injury rates. CONCLUSIONS: A cost-benefit analysis indicates an estimated savings of $90,000 over 4 months. A yearly practice-based education program and improvement in electronic health records is advocated to sustain this decrease in nursing injury rates.

However, whether the existence of second phase particles in the alloys exerts influence on the biocompatibility is still not clear. A deeper understanding of how the particles regulate specific biological responses is becoming a crucial requirement for their subsequent biomedical application. In this work, the in vitro biocompatibility of Mg17 Al12 as a common second phase in biodegradable Mg-Al-Zn alloys was investigated via hemolysis, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and cell adhesion tests. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by the extracellular matrix mineralization assay. The Mg17 Al12 particles were also prepared to simulate the real situation of second phase in the in vivo environment in order to estimate the cellular response in macrophages to the Mg17 Al12 particles. The experimental results indicated that no hemolysis was found and an excellent cytocompatibility was also proved for the Mg17 Al12 second phase when co-cultured with L929 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells and BMSCs. Macrophage phagocytosis co-culture test revealed that Mg17 Al12 particles exerted no harmful effect on RAW264.7 macrophages and could be phagocytized by the RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the possible inflammatory reaction and metabolic way for Mg17 Al12 phase were also discussed in detail. This article is protected by copyright.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Summary Mature oocytes are arrested in metaphase II due to the presence of high levels of active maturation promoting factor (MPF). After fertilization, active MPF levels decline abruptly, enabling oocytes to complete meiosis II. One of the first and universal events of oocyte activation is an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that would be responsible for MPF inactivation. Mature oocytes can also be activated by parthenogenetic activation. The aims of this work are to test the ability of dehydroleucodine (DhL) and its hydrogenated derivative 11,13-dihydro-dehydroleucodine (2H-DhL) to induce chemical activation in amphibian oocytes and to study the participation of calcium in the process. Results indicated that DhL and 2H-DhL induced oocyte activation in a dose-dependent manner. After 90 min of treatment, DhL 36 μM was able to induce 95% activation, while 2H-DhL 36 μM was less active, with only 40% activation. Our results suggest that DhL induced the inhibition of MPF activity, probably by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Extracellular Ca2+ would not be significant, although Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is critical. In this sense, IP3Rs and RyRs were involved in the Ca2+ transient induced by lactones. In this species, RyRs appears to be the largest contributor to Ca2+ release in DhL-induced activation. Although more studies are needed on the mechanism of action through which these lactones induce oocyte activation in Rhinella arenarum, the results of this research provide interesting perspectives for the use of these lactones as chemical activators in in vitro fertilization and cloning.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Zygote (Cambridge, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fertilization in Vitro","uri":{"id":"D005307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Maturation-Promoting Factor","uri":{"id":"D016200","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Amphibians","uri":{"id":"D000663","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Calcium","uri":{"id":"D002118","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytosol","uri":{"id":"D003600","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fertility","uri":{"id":"D005298","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fertilization","uri":{"id":"D005306","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrogen","uri":{"id":"D006859","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrogenation","uri":{"id":"D006865","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oocytes","uri":{"id":"D009865","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fertilizers","uri":{"id":"D005308","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactones","uri":{"id":"D007783","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Meiosis","uri":{"id":"D008540","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metaphase","uri":{"id":"D008677","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424172","title":"Chemical activation in Rhinella arenarum oocytes: effect of dehydroleucodine (DhL) and its hydrogenated derivative (2H-DhL).","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Astigmatism is an important refractive condition in children. However, the functional impact of uncorrected astigmatism in this population is not well established, particularly with regard to academic performance. This study investigated the impact of simulated bilateral astigmatism on academic-related tasks before and after sustained near work in children. METHODS: Twenty visually normal children (mean age: 10.8 ± 0.7 years; six males and 14 females) completed a range of standardised academic-related tests with and without 1.50 D of simulated bilateral astigmatism (with both academic-related tests and the visual condition administered in a randomised order). The simulated astigmatism was induced using a positive cylindrical lens while maintaining a plano spherical equivalent. Performance was assessed before and after 20 min of sustained near work, during two separate testing sessions. Academic-related measures included a standardised reading test (the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability), visual information processing tests (Coding and Symbol Search subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) and a reading-related eye movement test (the Developmental Eye Movement test). Each participant was systematically assigned either with-the-rule (WTR, axis 180°) or against-the-rule (ATR, axis 90°) simulated astigmatism to evaluate the influence of axis orientation on any decrements in performance. RESULTS: Reading, visual information processing and reading-related eye movement performance were all significantly impaired by both simulated bilateral astigmatism (p < 0.001) and sustained near work (p < 0.001), however, there was no significant interaction between these factors (p > 0.05). Simulated astigmatism led to a reduction of between 5% and 12% in performance across the academic-related outcome measures, but there was no significant effect of the axis (WTR or ATR) of astigmatism (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Simulated bilateral astigmatism impaired children's performance on a range of academic-related outcome measures irrespective of the orientation of the astigmatism. These findings have implications for the clinical management of non-amblyogenic levels of astigmatism in relation to academic performance in children. Correction of low to moderate levels of astigmatism may improve the functional performance of children in the classroom.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eye Movements","uri":{"id":"D005133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Automatic Data Processing","uri":{"id":"D001330","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Axis","uri":{"id":"D001368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reading","uri":{"id":"D011932","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Symbolism","uri":{"id":"D013561","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Astigmatism","uri":{"id":"D001251","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intelligence","uri":{"id":"D007360","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424167","title":"Simulated astigmatism impairs academic-related performance in children.","year":"2014"}

The quantity of the adventitious roots and the survival ratio were increased significantly as the length of the rhizome increased (P < 0.01), but the length of the rhizome had no remarkable effect on the content of glycyrrhizin. The average content of the glycyrrhizin in the adventitious root and rhizome could reach 3.03% and 2.12% after 3-year wild tending, respectively, and this results indicated that the quality of the glycyrrhiza using this method was much better than that from cultured glycyrrhiza with the reproducing method of seeding. so using the rhizome as reproductive material to produce the glycyrrhiza under the wild tending condition could get the high quality glycyrrhiza quick- ly and steadily, this phenomenon could be explained by the Hypothesis of synthetic inertia of the medicinal components from the wild material of G. uralensis.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Gait recognition is a useful biometric trait for person authentication because it is usable even with low image resolution. One challenge is robustness to a view change (crossview matching); view transformation models (VTMs) have been proposed to solve this. VTMs work well if the target views are the same as their discrete training views. However, gait traits are observed from an arbitrary view in a real situation. Thus, target views may not coincide with discrete training views, resulting in recognition accuracy degradation. We propose an arbitrary VTM (AVTM) that accurately matches a pair of gait traits from an arbitrary view. To realize an AVTM, we first construct threedimensional (3D) gait volume sequences of training subjects, disjoint from the test subjects in the target scene. We then generate two-dimensional (2D) gait silhouette sequences of the training subjects by projecting the 3D gait volume sequences onto the same views as the target views, and train the AVTM with gait features extracted from the 2D sequences. In addition, we extend our AVTM by incorporating a part-dependent view selection scheme (AVTM PdVS), which divides the gait feature into several parts, and sets part-dependent destination views for transformation. Because appropriate destination views may differ for different body parts, the part-dependent destination view selection can suppress transformation errors, leading to increased recognition accuracy. Experiments using datasets collected in different settings show that the AVTM improves the accuracy of cross-view matching and that the AVTM PdVS further improves the accuracy in many cases, particularly in verification scenarios.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Body","uri":{"id":"D018594","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25423652","title":"Gait-based Person Recognition Using Arbitrary View Transformation Model.","year":"2014"}

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of BSO-induced oxidative stress on histological structure of testis, testosterone secretion and semen parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male BALB/c mice were divided into 3 groups. In control group, the mice did not receive any chemical. In the experimental group, the mice received 2 mmol/kg BSO for 35 days. In the sham group, the mice received the solvent of BSO (0.9% saline). After the treatment, the mice were sacrificed. Their testes were fixed in Buein's fixative, embedded in paraffin and prepared for histological studies. To assess semen parameters, the sperms were collected from cauda epididymis. Blood samples were used for determination of super oxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and the serum testosterone level. The data analyzed using ANOVA and Dunnett's tests and SPSS software, version11.5. P- values at 0.05 level considered significant. RESULTS: Data showed that in experimental group in comparison to control group; the concentration of CAT, GPX, SOD,GSH and the total level of testosterone is reduced while MDA level is increased significantly. The number of sperms with progressive motility were decreased (P<0.001) but sperms with abnormal morphology were increased (P<0.001).

Chromatographic fingerprinting has been widely accepted as a crucial method for qualitative and quantitative analyses for TCM. Zhi Zhu Wan (ZZW), a classical Chinese medical formula, has been commonly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, which pose a serious challenge to its quality control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work, a sensitive and reliable method of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) was developed to control the quality of ZZW for chemical fingerprint analysis and quantitative analysis of four major bioactive constituents, including hesperidin, naringin, neohesperidin, and atractylenolide I. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters Symmetry C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size), with an aqueous 0.095% phosphate acid and acetonitrile mobile phase gradient. RESULTS: Optimization of other experimental conditions was validated with satisfactory accuracy, precision, repeatability, and recovery. In quantitative analysis, the four components showed good regression (R > 0.9994) within test ranges, and the recovery method ranged from 99.32% to 100.630%. HPLC fingerprints of the ZZW samples were compared by performing similarity analysis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the newly developed HPLC-PDA fingerprint method would be suitable for quality control of ZZW.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Pharmacognosy magazine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine, Traditional","uri":{"id":"D008519","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Control","uri":{"id":"D011786","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromatography, Liquid","uri":{"id":"D002853","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","uri":{"id":"D005767","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine, Chinese Traditional","uri":{"id":"D008516","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Particle Size","uri":{"id":"D010316","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Control","uri":{"id":"D011786","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromatography","uri":{"id":"D002845","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Constitution and Bylaws","uri":{"id":"D003249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phosphates","uri":{"id":"D010710","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetonitriles","uri":{"id":"D000097","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid","uri":{"id":"D002851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hesperidin","uri":{"id":"D006569","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422548","title":"Chromatographic fingerprinting analysis of Zhizhu Wan preparation by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector.","year":"2014"}

HCFC-22 contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion, and both species are potent greenhouse gases. In this work, we study in situ observations of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a taken from research aircraft over the Pacific Ocean in a 3-y span [HIaper-Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) 2009-2011] and combine these data with long-term ground observations from global surface sites [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) networks]. We find the global annual emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a have increased substantially over the past two decades. Emissions of HFC-134a are consistently higher compared with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory since 2000, by 60% more in recent years (2009-2012). Apart from these decadal emission constraints, we also quantify recent seasonal emission patterns showing that summertime emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a are two to three times higher than wintertime emissions. This unforeseen large seasonal variation indicates that unaccounted mechanisms controlling refrigerant gas emissions are missing in the existing inventory estimates. Possible mechanisms enhancing refrigerant losses in summer are (i) higher vapor pressure in the sealed compartment of the system at summer high temperatures and (ii) more frequent use and service of refrigerators and air conditioners in summer months. Our results suggest that engineering (e.g., better temperature/vibration-resistant system sealing and new system design of more compact/efficient components) and regulatory (e.g., reinforcing system service regulations) steps to improve containment of these gases from working devices could effectively reduce their release to the atmosphere.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pacific Ocean","uri":{"id":"D010140","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Air Conditioning","uri":{"id":"D000389","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seasons","uri":{"id":"D012621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"United Nations","uri":{"id":"D014480","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vapor Pressure","uri":{"id":"D055548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Climate Change","uri":{"id":"D057231","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stratospheric Ozone","uri":{"id":"D062952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ozone Depletion","uri":{"id":"D062966","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atmosphere","uri":{"id":"D001272","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Climate","uri":{"id":"D002980","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Containment of Biohazards","uri":{"id":"D003264","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pressure","uri":{"id":"D011312","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seasons","uri":{"id":"D012621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temperature","uri":{"id":"D013696","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internationality","uri":{"id":"D038622","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aircraft","uri":{"id":"D000401","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Conditioning (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D003213","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gases","uri":{"id":"D005740","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ozone","uri":{"id":"D010126","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Refrigeration","uri":{"id":"D012034","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reinforcement (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D012054","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422438","title":"Global emissions of refrigerants HCFC-22 and HFC-134a: Unforeseen seasonal contributions.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Gitelman syndrome (GS) and Bartter syndrome (BS) are hereditary salt-losing tubulopathies (SLTs) resulting from defects of renal proteins involved in electrolyte reabsorption, as for sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) and furosemide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) cotransporters, affected in GS and BS Type 1 patients, respectively. Currently, definitive diagnosis is obtained through expensive and time-consuming genetic testing. Urinary exosomes (UE), nanovesicles released by every epithelial cell facing the urinary space, represent an ideal source of markers for renal dysfunction and injury, because UE molecular composition stands for the cell of origin. On these assumptions, the aim of this work is to evaluate the relevance of UE for the diagnosis of SLTs. METHODS: UE were purified from second morning urines collected from 32 patients with genetically proven SLTs (GS, BS1, BS2 and BS3 patients), 4 with unclassified SLTs and 22 control subjects (age and sex matched). The levels of NCC and NKCC2 were evaluated in UE by SDS-PAGE/western blotting with specific antibodies. RESULTS: Due to their location on the luminal side of tubular cells, NCC and NKCC2 are well represented in UE proteome. The NCC signal is significantly decreased/absent in UE of Gitelman patients compared with control subjects (Mann-Whitney t-test, P < 0.001) and, similarly, the NKCC2 in those of Bartter type 1 (P < 0.001). The difference in the levels of the two proteins allows recognition of Gitelman and Bartter type 1 patients from controls and, combined with clinical data, from other Bartter patients. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis using UE NCC densitometric values showed a good discriminating power of the test comparing GS patients versus controls and BS patients (area under the curve value = 0.92; sensitivity 84.2% and specificity 88.6%). CONCLUSIONS: UE phenotyping may be useful in the diagnosis of GS and BS, thus providing an alternative/complementary, urine-based diagnostic tool for SLT patient recognition and a diagnostic guidance in complex cases.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal

In this study, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out on 53 matched pairs of CRC and adjacent normal mucosa to investigate the expression levels of miR-376a. According to the high or low expression of miR-376a, patients were divided into two groups. The relationship between miR-376a expression and clinicopathological factors of 53 patients was evaluated. Survival analysis of 53 CRC patients was performed with clinical follow- up information and survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on sections of paraffin-embedded tissue to investigate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. MiR-376a showed low expression in cancer tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues and altered high miR-376a expression tended to be positively correlated with advanced lymph node metastasis and shorter patient survival.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Differences in survival of breast cancer have been noted among racial and ethnic groups, but the reasons for these disparities remain unclear. This study presents the characteristics and the survival curve of two racial and ethnic groups and evaluates the effects of race on survival times by measuring the lifetime data-based half-normal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The distributions among racial and ethnic groups are compared using female breast cancer patients from nine states in the country all taken from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End RESULTS cancer registry. The main end points observed are: age at diagnosis, survival time in months, and marital status. The right skewed half-normal statistical probability model is used to show the differences in the survival times between black Hispanic (BH) and black non-Hispanic (BNH) female breast cancer patients. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio are used to estimate and compare the relative risk of death in two minority groups, BH and BNH. RESULTS: A probability random sample method was used to select representative samples from BNH and BH female breast cancer patients, who were diagnosed during the years of 1973-2009 in the United States. The sample contained 1,000 BNH and 298 BH female breast cancer patients. The median age at diagnosis was 57.75 years among BNH and 54.11 years among BH. The results of the half-normal model showed that the survival times formed positive skewed models with higher variability in BNH compared with BH. The Kaplan-Meir estimate was used to plot the survival curves for cancer patients; this test was positively skewed. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio for survival analysis showed that BNH had a significantly longer survival time as compared to BH which is consistent with the results of the half-normal model. CONCLUSIONS: The findings with the proposed model strategy will assist in the healthcare field to measure future outcomes for BH and BNH, given their past history and conditions. These findings may provide an enhanced and improved outlook for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients in the United States.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Asian Pacific journal

However, the function and molecular mechanisms of action of CXCR7 in human cervical cancer are still unclear. In the present study a loss of-function approach was used to observe the effects of recombinant CXCR7 specific small interfering RNA pBSilence1.1 plasmids on biological behavior including proliferative activity and invasive potential, as indicated by MTT assays with the cervical cancer SiHa cell line in vitro. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting revealed that CXCR7 was downregulated in transfected compared with control cells, associated with inhibited cell growth, invasiveness and migration. The expression of CXCR7 and CXCL12 was also determined immunohistochemically in 152 paraffin-embedded, cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or normal cervical epithelial to assess clinico-pathological pattern and CXCR7 status with respect to cell differentiation and lymph node metastasis in Uighur patients with CSCC. CXCR7 and CXCL12 expression was higher in cervical cancer than CIN and normal cervical mucosa, especially in those with higher stage and lymph node metastasis. CXCL12 appeared to be positively regulated by CXCR7 at the post-transcriptional level in CSCC. We propose that aberrant expression of CXCR7 plays a role in carcinogenesis, differentiation and metastasis of CSCC, implying its use as a potential target for clinical biomarkers in differentiation and lymph node metastasis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","uri":{"id":"D002294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","uri":{"id":"D002294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Differentiation","uri":{"id":"D002454","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cell Line","uri":{"id":"D002460","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph Nodes","uri":{"id":"D008198","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D002583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blotting, Western","uri":{"id":"D015153","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia","uri":{"id":"D018290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Small Interfering","uri":{"id":"D034741","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reverse Transcription","uri":{"id":"D048348","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emigration and Immigration","uri":{"id":"D004641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymph","uri":{"id":"D008196","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mucous Membrane","uri":{"id":"D009092","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Metastasis","uri":{"id":"D009362","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Plasmids","uri":{"id":"D010957","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Down-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Up-Regulation","uri":{"id":"D015854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinogenesis","uri":{"id":"D063646","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422203","title":"Role of CXCR7 and Effects on CXCL12 in SiHa Cells and Upregulation in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Uighur Women.","year":"2014"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of DcR3, caspase-3, Bcl-2, VEGF, Ki-67, PCNA and P53 in 166 BUC and 56 normal bladder tissues. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of DcR3 in the supernatants of cultured BUC cells. RESULTS: Overexpression of DcR3 was found in BUC tissues and cell lines, with significant elevation as compared to normal bladder tissues (p<0.0001). Higher DcR3 expression was related to the status of invasion, lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Furthermore, DcR3 expression was negatively correlated with caspase-3 and positively associated with Bcl-2, VEGF, Ki-67 labeling index (LI), PCNA LI and P53 (all p<0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DcR3 may play a crucial role as an oncogene in tumorigenesis, deterioration and progress of BUC via influencing related pathways of apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is dependent on identifying actionable mutations in tumors. Accurate detection of mutations is often problematic in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues is fragmented and also contains DNA lesions that are the sources of sequence artifacts. Sequence artifacts can be difficult to distinguish from true mutations, especially in the context of tumor heterogeneity, and are an increasing interpretive problem in this era of massively parallel sequencing. Understanding of the sources of sequence artifacts in FFPE tissues and implementation of preventative strategies are critical to improve the accurate detection of actionable mutations. CONTENT: This minireview focuses on DNA template lesions in FFPE tissues as the source of sequence artifacts in molecular analysis. In particular, fragmentation, base modification including uracil and thymine deriving from cytosine deamination, and abasic sites are discussed as indirect or direct sources of sequence artifacts. We discuss strategies that can be implemented to minimize sequence artifacts and to distinguish true mutations from sequence artifacts. These strategies are applicable for the detection of actionable mutations in both single amplicon and massively parallel amplicon sequencing approaches. SUMMARY: Because FFPE tissues are usually the only available material for DNA analysis, it is important to maximize the accurate informational content from FFPE DNA. Careful consideration of each step in the workflow is needed to minimize sequence artifacts. In addition, validation of actionable mutations either by appropriate experimental design or by orthogonal methods should be considered.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Clinical chemistry","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","uri":{"id":"D059014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Design","uri":{"id":"D012107","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","uri":{"id":"D059014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mutation","uri":{"id":"D009154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Artifacts","uri":{"id":"D016477","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Workflow","uri":{"id":"D057188","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cytosine","uri":{"id":"D003596","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Deamination","uri":{"id":"D003641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thymine","uri":{"id":"D013941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thymopoietins","uri":{"id":"D013946","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Uracil","uri":{"id":"D014498","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421801","title":"Sequence Artifacts in DNA from Formalin-Fixed Tissues: Causes and Strategies for Minimization.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Anxiety control beliefs have emerged as a trans-diagnostic risk factor for anxiety disorders and a potential mechanism of change in cognitive and behavioral therapies. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between anxiety control beliefs and anxiety disorder symptoms following exposure to hurricanes in youth and test a developmental hypothesis about those associations. METHODS: A large school-based sample of (N = 1048) children and adolescents with a history of exposure to natural disaster were assessed with the short form of the Anxiety Control Questionnaire for Children (ACQ-C), symptom measures (PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms) and level of disaster exposure. Developmental differences in the association between ACQ-C scores and symptoms were tested, as well as the ACQ-C's ability to assess symptoms beyond level of exposure. RESULTS: ACQ-C scores were associated with symptoms beyond level of exposure, but age moderated the strength of the association. Modeling the interaction suggested that the ACQ-C short had incremental validity beyond hurricane exposure in youth over 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: Findings extend previous work to a novel population of youth and add to the developmental understanding of the role of anxiety control beliefs in anxiety regulation. Age differences in the linkages between anxiety control and symptoms is consistent with a developmental model where low perceived control exhibited by younger children may be less indicative of problems with anxiety but may instead be related to normal cognitive development.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Depression and anxiety","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety Disorders","uri":{"id":"D001008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Behavior Therapy","uri":{"id":"D001521","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disasters","uri":{"id":"D004190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Symptom Assessment","uri":{"id":"D063189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Child","uri":{"id":"D002648","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Disasters","uri":{"id":"D004190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","uri":{"id":"D013313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cyclonic Storms","uri":{"id":"D055867","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421545","title":"DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN THE LINKAGES BETWEEN ANXIETY CONTROL BELIEFS AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS IN YOUTH.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: In randomized trials, pair-matching is an intuitive design strategy to protect study validity and to potentially increase study power. In a common design, candidate units are identified, and their baseline characteristics used to create the best n/2 matched pairs. Within the resulting pairs, the intervention is randomized, and the outcomes measured at the end of follow-up. We consider this design to be adaptive, because the construction of the matched pairs depends on the baseline covariates of all candidate units. As a consequence, the observed data cannot be considered as n/2 independent, identically distributed pairs of units, as common practice assumes. Instead, the observed data consist of n dependent units. This paper explores the consequences of adaptive pair-matching in randomized trials for estimation of the average treatment effect, conditional the baseline covariates of the n study units. By avoiding estimation of the covariate distribution, estimators of this conditional effect will often be more precise than estimators of the marginal effect. We contrast the unadjusted estimator with targeted minimum loss based estimation and show substantial efficiency gains from matching and further gains with adjustment.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Although night-shift work has been associated with elevated risk of breast cancer in numerous epidemiologic studies, evidence is not consistent. We conducted a nested case-cohort study to investigate a possible association between shift work including a night shift and risk of breast cancer within a large cohort of women textile workers in Shanghai, China. METHODS: The study included 1,709 incident breast cancer cases and 4,780 non-cases. Data on historical shift work schedules were collected by categorized jobs from the factories, where the study subjects had worked, and then were linked to the complete work histories of each subject. No jobs in the factories involved exclusively night-shift work. Therefore, night shift was evaluated as part of a rotating shift work pattern. Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling adapted for the case-cohort design for years of night-shift work and the total number of nights worked. Additionally, analyses were repeated with exposures lagged by 10 and 20 years. RESULTS: We observed no associations with either years of night-shift work or number of nights worked during the entire employment period, irrespective of lag intervals. Findings from the age-stratified analyses were very similar to those observed for the entire study population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide no evidence to support the hypothesis that shift work increases breast cancer risk. The positive association between shift work and breast cancer observed in Western populations, but not observed in this and other studies of the Chinese population, suggests that the effect of shift work on breast cancer risk may be different in Asian and Caucasian women.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cancer causes & control : CCC","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proportional Hazards Models","uri":{"id":"D016016","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epidemiologic Studies","uri":{"id":"D016021","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Appointments and Schedules","uri":{"id":"D001071","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"China","uri":{"id":"D002681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rotation","uri":{"id":"D012399","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asian Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044466","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Textiles","uri":{"id":"D013784","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421377","title":"Shift work and breast cancer among women textile workers in Shanghai, China.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking claims 700 000 lives every year in Europe and the cost of tobacco smoking in the EU is estimated between €98 and €130 billion annually; direct medical care costs and indirect costs such as workday losses each represent half of this amount. Policymakers all across Europe are in need of bespoke information on the economic and wider returns of investing in evidence-based tobacco control, including smoking cessation agendas. EQUIPT is designed to test the transferability of one such economic evidence base-the English Tobacco Return on Investment (ROI) tool-to other EU member states. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: EQUIPT is a multicentre, interdisciplinary comparative effectiveness research study in public health. The Tobacco ROI tool already developed in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will be adapted to meet the needs of European decision-makers, following transferability criteria. Stakeholders' needs and intention to use ROI tools in sample countries (Germany, Hungary, Spain and the Netherlands) will be analysed through interviews and surveys and complemented by secondary analysis of the contextual and other factors. Informed by this contextual analysis, the next phase will develop country-specific ROI tools in sample countries using a mix of economic modelling and Visual Basic programming. The results from the country-specific ROI models will then be compared to derive policy proposals that are transferable to other EU states, from which a centralised web tool will be developed. This will then be made available to stakeholders to cater for different decision-making contexts across Europe. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Brunel University Ethics Committee and relevant authorities in each of the participating countries approved the protocol. EQUIPT has a dedicated work package on dissemination, focusing on stakeholders' communication needs. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, e-learning resources and policy briefs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMJ open","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care","uri":{"id":"health_care_category","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Public Health","uri":{"id":"D011634","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Smoking Cessation","uri":{"id":"D016540","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Health Care Costs","uri":{"id":"D017048","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Institutes of Health (U.S.)","uri":{"id":"D009316","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Smoking","uri":{"id":"D012907","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ethics Committees","uri":{"id":"D017041","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Economic","uri":{"id":"D018803","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comparative Effectiveness Research","uri":{"id":"D057186","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Academies and Institutes","uri":{"id":"D000047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anniversaries and Special Events","uri":{"id":"D000846","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communication","uri":{"id":"D003142","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe","uri":{"id":"D005060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Netherlands","uri":{"id":"D009426","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"England","uri":{"id":"D004739","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germany","uri":{"id":"D005858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hungary","uri":{"id":"D006814","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spain","uri":{"id":"D013030","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421342","title":"EQUIPT: protocol of a comparative effectiveness research study evaluating cross-context transferability of economic evidence on tobacco control.","year":"2014"}

Therefore, we investigated the consistency of the associations of patient, disease and healthcare system factors identified in previous population-based research to understand their generalizability to other low-incidence populations. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with Stage IV gastric cancer in Ontario between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2008 was performed. Kaplan-Meier methodology and the log-rank test were used for bivariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, patient, disease and healthcare system factors were independent predictors of survival. Increasing age per 10 years (HR 1.07; 95 % CI 1.02-1.10), a tumor located in the gastroesophageal junction (HR 1.09; 95 % CI 0.94-1.27) or middle of the stomach (HR 1.14; 95 % CI 0.97-1.35), presence of carcinomatosis (HR 1.61; 95 % CI 1.42-1.83) and a larger burden of metastatic disease (2-3 sites of metastatic disease: HR 1.17; 95 % CI 1.03-1.32; ≥4 sites: HR 1.69; 95 % CI 1.30-2.20) were associated with worse prognosis. Female gender, receipt of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and treatment from a high-volume, gastric cancer specialist were all associated with significantly better prognosis. In addition, there was evidence of significant geographic variation in survival. CONCLUSION: This study provides supporting evidence for patient, disease and healthcare system prognostic factors in metastatic gastric cancer. Future work investigating the role of emerging molecular and biologic information will need to take these established prognostic factors into consideration.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retrospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D012189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stomach Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D013274","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Multivariate Analysis","uri":{"id":"D015999","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Confidence Intervals","uri":{"id":"D016001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Esophagogastric Junction","uri":{"id":"D004943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Delivery of Health Care","uri":{"id":"D003695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ontario","uri":{"id":"D009864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiotherapy","uri":{"id":"D011878","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Survival","uri":{"id":"D013534","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421300","title":"Prognostic factors in metastatic gastric cancer: results of a population-based, retrospective cohort study in Ontario.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: It is recognised that the worksite catering sector is likely to play a pivotal role in influencing dietary intake in adults of working age. The present study aimed to assess the feasibility of engaging worksites in a healthy eating intervention, implementing a price incentivised main meal intervention and measuring indicative intervention responses to inform the design of a future trial. METHODS: Workplaces registered with the Scottish Healthy Living Award were invited to participate. The EatSMART intervention (a reduced price, healthy meal combination plus promotions) was implemented over 10 weeks in two worksites. Implementation was assessed by observational and sales data. Indicative effects on food habits were measured using online pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Focus group discussions and interviews were used to determine catering staff and consumer acceptability. RESULTS: Thirty-seven worksites were invited to participate and four worksites responded positively. Two sites (with 1600 and 500 employees, respectively) participated. Both required significant implementation support. Estimated sales data indicated that the uptake of promoted items varied by week (range 60-187 items) and by site. A poor response rate from questionnaires limited the evaluation of intervention impact. Consumers reported improved value for money and quality.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Centrosome abnormalities have been observed in nearly all human solid tumors, but their role in tumorigenesis is unclear. We have demonstrated that autoantibodies reacting with antigens in centrosomes are frequently found in BC sera. In this work, we attempted to characterize the centrosome antigens associated with BC. We immunoscreened a T7 cDNA library of BC proteins with BC sera, and the autoantigens identified were printed as a microarray and hybridized with BC and control sera. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate the expression of the cloned autoantigens in BC tissue. Immunoscreening with BC sera led to the cloning of autoantibodies recognizing epitopes developing in a family of proteins located on centrosomes such as peri-centriolar material-1, isomorph CRA, stathmin1, HS actin gamma1, SUMO/sentrin peptidase 2, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1. Antibody reactivity to these proteins that are associated with centrosome assembly and/or microtubule function was highly associated with the diagnosis of BC. IHC staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with specific antibodies showed that aurora and stathmin are expressed in BC. The discovery of autoantibodies to important centrosome antigens associated with BC suggests that this immune reactivity could be related to autoimmunity developing in BC. Our finding that some of these antibodies are also present in a group of healthy women suggests that breakdown of tolerance to centrosome proteins may occur early in breast carcinogenesis and that autoantibodies to centrosome antigens might be biomarkers of early BC.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Immunologic

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The reverse Warburg effect describes the phenomenon that epithelial cancer cells take advantage of the metabolic machinery from nearby cancer-associated fibroblast, inducing them to produce lactate and ketones to fuel the high metabolic demands of the epithelial tumour tissues. This is in breast cancer observed as a lack of stromal caveolin-1 (CAV-1) and an increased expression of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT-4) in the tumour stroma, with a concomitant increase in the expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) in the epithelial, tumour compartment. The lack of CAV-1 and increased expression of MCT-4 have been shown to have prognostic importance, primarily in patients with breast cancer. However, this phenomenon has only scarcely been described in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Given the prognostic importance of myofibroblasts in OSCC, we also examined a potential relationship between the expression of MCT-4 and the presence of myofibroblasts. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 patients with OSCC were immunostained with antibodies towards MCT-1, MCT-4, Cav-1, GLUT-1, α-SMA, TOMM20 and KI-67, and evaluated for their specific epithelial and stromal expression. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with OSCC, we find an increased expression of MCT-1 and MCT-4 in both the epithelial and stromal compartment, with almost no overlap in their spatial expression. We found a large spatial overlap between α-SMA and MCT-1 in the stroma compartment, but no relationship between MCT-4 and myofibroblasts. Interestingly, we did not observe any relationship between the absence of CAV-1 and the presence of MCT-4 as has been shown in breast carcinomas.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","uri":{"id":"D002294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epithelial Cells","uri":{"id":"D004847","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Breast Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D001943","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell","uri":{"id":"D002294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antibodies","uri":{"id":"D000906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fibroblasts","uri":{"id":"D005347","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ketones","uri":{"id":"D007659","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactates","uri":{"id":"D007773","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactation","uri":{"id":"D007774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lactic Acid","uri":{"id":"D019344","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Caveolin 1","uri":{"id":"D051242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myofibroblasts","uri":{"id":"D058628","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25420473","title":"A reverse Warburg metabolism in oral squamous cell carcinoma is not dependent upon myofibroblasts.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Leadership studies which focus on categorising leadership styles have been critiqued for failure to consider the lived experience of leadership. The purpose of this paper is to use the framework of Jepson's model of contextual dynamics to explore whether this framework assists understanding of the \"how and why\" of lived leadership experience within the nursing profession. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Themes for a purposeful literature search and review, having regard to the Jepson model, are drawn from the contemporary and dynamic context of nursing. Government reports, coupled with preliminary interviews with a nurseleadership team, guided selection of contextual issues. FINDINGS: The contextual interactions arising from managerialism, existing hierarchical models of leadership and increasing knowledge work provided insights into leadership experience in nursing, in the contexts of professional identity and changing educational and generational profiles of nurses. The authors conclude that employing a contextual frame provides insights in studying leadership experience. The author propose additions to the cultural and institutional dimensions of Jepson's model. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings have implications for structuring and communicating key roles and policies relevant to nursing leadership. These include the need to: address perceptions around the legitimacy of current nursing leaders to provide clinical leadership; modify hierarchical models of nursing leadership; address implications of the role of the knowledge workers. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Observing nursing leadership through the lens of Jepson's model of contextual dynamics confirms that this is an important way of exploring how leadership is enacted. The authors found, however, the model also provided a useful frame for considering the experience and understanding of leadership by those to be led.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of health organization and management","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Nursing","uri":{"id":"D016294","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Government","uri":{"id":"D006076","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Leadership","uri":{"id":"D007857","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perception","uri":{"id":"D010465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Communism","uri":{"id":"D003148","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Illegitimacy","uri":{"id":"D007086","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25420358","title":"Context and the leadership experiences and perceptions of professionals: a review of the nursing profession.","year":"2014"}

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Clinical providers at the USA Veterans Health Administration were interviewed as part of planning organizational interventions. They discussed strengths, weaknesses, and desired changes in their workplaces. A subset of respondents also discussed workplace psychological safety (i.e. employee perceptions of being able to speak up or report errors without retaliation or ostracism--Edmondson, 1999). Two trained coders analysed the interview data using a grounded theory-based method. They excerpted passages that discussed job-related communication and summarized specific themes. Subsequent analyses compared frequencies of themes across workgroups defined as having psychologically safe vs unsafe climate based upon an independently administered employee survey. FINDINGS: Perceptions of work-related communication differed across clinical provider groups with high vs low psychological safety. The differences in frequencies of communication-related themes across the compared groups matched the expected pattern of problem-laden communication characterizing psychologically unsafe workplaces. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Previous research implied the existence of a connection between communication and psychological safety whereas this study offers substantive evidence of it. The paper summarized the differences in perceptions of communication in high vs low psychological safety environments drawing from qualitative data that reflected clinical providers' direct experience on the job.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Reports an error in \"Bayesian tests to quantify the result of a replication attempt\" by Josine Verhagen and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2014[Aug], Vol 143[4], 1457-1475). Three errors occurred in the Examples section. The errors are corrected in the erratum, and a more detailed description of the errata can be found on http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0038326.supp (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-21247-001.) Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, H₀ : δ = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis-the replication hypothesis-is given by Hr : δ ∼ \"posterior distribution from original study.\" The weighted-likelihood ratio between H₀ and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature.

Clinical data from patient records comprised gender, age at onset, date of first endolaryngeal procedure with biopsy, date of last follow-up, total number of endolaryngeal procedures, and complications during the observation period. Disease was defined as juvenile (JoRRP) or adult onset (AoRRP) according to whether the disease was acquired before or after the age of 18. Aggressive disease was defined as distal spread, tracheostomy, four surgical operations annually or >10 surgeries in total. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. HPV genotyping was performed by quantitative PCR assay identifying 15 HPV genotypes. The study included 224 patients. The majority were males (141/174 in AoRRPs and 31/50 in JoRRPs; p = 0.005). The median follow-up from initial diagnosis was 12.0 years (IQR 3.7-32.9) for JoRRPs and 4.0 years (IQR 0.8-11.7) for AoRRPs. The disease was more aggressive in juveniles than adults (p<0.001), a difference that disappeared after 10 years' observation. JoRRPs with aggressive disease were younger at onset (mean difference 4.6 years, 95%CI [2.4, 6.8], p = 0.009). HPV6 or -11 was present in all HPV-positive papillomas. HPV11 was more prevalent in aggressive disease, and HPV6 in non-aggressive disease (p<0.001). Multiple logistic regression revealed that only age at onset (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.53, 0.88], p = 0.003) was associated with aggressive disease in juveniles, while HPV11 (OR = 3.74, 95% CI [1.40, 9.97], p = 0.008) and observation time >10 years (OR = 13.41, 95% CI [5.46, 32.99[, p<001) were risk factors in adults. In conclusion, the only significant risk factor for developing aggressive disease in JoRRPs was age at onset, but both HPV11 and observation time >10 years were risk factors for an aggressive disease course in AoRRPs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cohort Studies","uri":{"id":"D015331","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age of Onset","uri":{"id":"D017668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biopsy","uri":{"id":"D001706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Recurrence","uri":{"id":"D012008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Complicity","uri":{"id":"D028661","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Papilloma","uri":{"id":"D010212","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tracheostomy","uri":{"id":"D014139","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419846","title":"Risk factors for aggressive recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in adults and juveniles.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: People can use a content-specific recapitulation strategy to trigger memories (i.e., mentally reinstating encoding conditions), but how people deploy this strategy is unclear. Is recapitulation naturally used to guide all recollection attempts, or is it only used selectively, after retrieving incomplete information that requires additional monitoring? According to a retrieval orientation model, people use recapitulation whenever they search memory for specific information, regardless of what information might come to mind. In contrast, according to a postretrieval monitoring model, people selectively engage recapitulation only after retrieving ambiguous information in order to evaluate this information and guide additional retrieval attempts. We tested between these models using a criterial recollection task, and by manipulating the strength of ambiguous information associated with to-be-rejected foils (i.e., familiarity or noncriterial information). Replicating prior work, foil rejections were greater when people attempted to recollect targets studied at a semantic level (deep test) compared to an orthographic level (shallow test), implicating more accurate retrieval monitoring. To investigate the role of a recapitulation strategy in this monitoring process, a final test assessed memory for the foils that were earlier processed on these recollection tests. Performance on this foil recognition test suggested that people had engaged in more elaborative content-specific recapitulation when initially tested for deep compared to shallow recollections, and critically, this elaboration effect did not interact with the experimental manipulation of foil strength. These results support the retrieval orientation model, whereby a recapitulation strategy was used to orient retrieval toward specific information during every recollection attempt.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Life story work has a relatively long tradition in the caring sciences and is recognised as an important component of dementia care and practice. However, to date, there has not been a review of accessible life story resources. The paper aims to discuss these issues. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Following a systematic approach to identification and inclusion, 11 life story resources were reviewed to ascertain areas of commonality and divergence between the materials. FINDINGS: The authors were able to group the analysis under eight areas and at the end of this process, it was uncertain if life story work is a formal staff intervention or an informal activity that people with dementia and their families could engage in. Resources also varied in terms of whether the life story information was organised in a chronological way, or with topics of interest/discussion or with a combination of both. Life story evaluation and its impact on the life of the person with dementia is in need of development. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Across the resources the authors identified four reasons to do life story work which the authors have named as: emotional connections; interactional connections; building new connections and practical care connections. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: There was limited guidance aimed at helping people with dementia to develop and compile their own life story. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper provides new insights into the usefulness, future directions and content of life story resources in dementia care. It will be of interest to those in health and social care as well as people living with dementia.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Quality in ageing and older adults","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dementia","uri":{"id":"D003704","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Science","uri":{"id":"D012586","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Empathy","uri":{"id":"D004645","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419453","title":"Life story resources in dementia care: a review.","year":"2014"}

However, inconsistent results have prevented its usage in clinical. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis aimed to systematically determine diagnostic accuracy of miR-106 in distinguishing patients with cancer from cancer-free controls and further evaluate its value serving as a biomarker in clinical. We conducted a systematically literature search in databases (PubMed, web of science, Embase and the Cochrane Library) collecting relevant articles up to July 22th, 2014. The overall diagnostic accuracy of miR-106 was assessed by the following indexes: sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR and DOR. The SROC curve with AUC value was also generated for the assessment. Due to the significant heterogeneity, the random effects approach was chosen in our analysis and meta-regression was performed to explore the potential source of it. We also tested potential presence of publication bias using Deeks' funnel plots test. Stata 12.0 statistical software was used for analysis in the present study. Overall, the 11 studies involving 756 cancer patients and 834 controls were considered eligible in our analysis. The results in our work showed that sensitivity of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.44-0.68) and specificity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72-0.92), with the under area AUC value of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.79) for miR-106 assay. Additionally, the combined PLR, NLR and DOR describing the discriminatory ability were 3.7 (95% CI: 2.2-6.2), 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42-0.62) and 7 (95% CI: 4-12) in the present analysis. The results in our meta-analysis showed that miR-106 had moderate accuracy in identifying cancer patients. Thus, further larger-scale prospective studies are needed to improve the diagnostic efficiency and explore the combination of miR-106 and other biomarkers with more pronounced accuracy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of clinical and experimental medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prospective Studies","uri":{"id":"D011446","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publication Bias","uri":{"id":"D017594","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Libraries","uri":{"id":"D007990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Science","uri":{"id":"D012586","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Software","uri":{"id":"D012984","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bias (Epidemiology)","uri":{"id":"D015982","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Area Under Curve","uri":{"id":"D019540","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"PubMed","uri":{"id":"D039781","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419428","title":"Evaluation and identification of microRNA-106 in the diagnosis of cancer: a meta-analysis.","year":"2014"}

Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to determine ERβ expression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Difference in survival was analyzed by the Log-Rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of ERβ expression in breast cancer patients. The ERβ high and over expression rate in 490 breast patients was 22.4% (110/490). ERβ expression was not associated with clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer. The mean survival time in patients with ERβ negative expression, ERβ low expression, ERβ high expression and ERβ over expression was 9.9 years, 9.2 years, 8.6 years and 5.6 years. Statistically, patients with ERβ high and over expression had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) time compared with the patients with ERβ negative and low expression. The Cox multivariate analysis revealed that ERβ high and over expression, the pathologic stages of tumor and chemotherapy were the independent predictors for poor DFS in breast cancer patients. ERβ expression is an independent prognostic factor of breast cancer patients and its high and over expression indicates poor prognosis of breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma compared to healthy endometrium. These miRNAs can potentially be used to develop a panel for classification and prognosis in order to better predict the progression of the disease and facilitate the choice of treatment strategy. METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded endometrial tissue samples were collected from the Örebro university hospital. QPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of 742 miRNAs in 30 malignant and 20 normal endometrium samples. After normalization of the qPCR data, miRNAs differing significantly in expression between normal and cancer samples were identified, and hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify groups of miRNAs with coordinated expression profiles. RESULTS: In comparisons between endometrial adenocarcinoma and normal endometrium samples 138 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed (p < 0.001) among which 112 miRNAs have not been previous reported for endometrial adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that several miRNAs are differentially expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma. These identified miRNA hold great potential as target for classification and prognosis of this disease.

This work aimed to create new insights on the fundamental mechanisms of the plant extracts involved in these activities. RESULTS: In thrombolytic activity assay, a significant clot disruption was observed at dose of 1 mg/mL for each of the extracts (volume 100 μL) when compared to the standard drug streptokinase. The n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and crude methanolic extracts showed 32.23 ± 0.26, 37.67 ± 1.31, 43.13 ± 0.85, and 46.78 ± 0.9% clot lysis, respectively, whereas the positive control streptokinase showed 93.35 ± 0.35% disruption at the dose of 30,000 I.U. In hot plate method, the highest pain inhibitory activity was found at a dose of 500 mg/kg of crude extract (15.54 ± 0.37 sec) which differed significantly (P <0.01 and P <0.001) with that of the standard drug ketorolac (16.38 ± 0.27 sec). In acetic acid induced writhing test, the crude methanolic extract showed significant (P <0.01 and P <0.001) analgesic potential at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (45.98 and 56.32% inhibition, respectively), where ketorolac showed 64.36% inhibition. In anti-inflammatory activity test, the crude methanolic extract showed significant (P <0.001) potential at doses 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (1.51 ± 0.04 and 1.47 ± 0.03 mm paw edema, respectively), where ketorolac showed 1.64 ± 0.05 mm edema after 3 h of carrageenan injection. In antipyretic activity assay, the crude extract showed notable reduction in body temperature (32.78 ± 0.46°C) at dose of 500 mg/kg-body weight, when the standard (at dose 150 mg/kg-body weight) exerted 33.32 ± 0.67°C temperature after 3 h of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results yield that the crude hydroalcoholic extract has better effects than the other in all trials. In the context, it can be said that the leaves of L. glutinosa possess remarkable pharmacological effects, and justify its traditional use as analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and thrombolytic agent.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Biological

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Individualized targeted therapies for cancer patients require accurate and reproducible assessment of biomarkers to be able to plan treatment accordingly. Recent studies have shown highly variable effects of preanalytical variables on gene expression profiling and protein levels of different tissue types. Several publications have described protein degradation of tissue samples as a direct result of delay of formalin fixation of the tissue. Phosphorylated proteins are more labile and epitope degradation can happen within 30 min of cold ischemic time. To address this issue, we evaluated the change in antigenicity of a series of phosphoproteins in paraffin-embedded samples from breast tumors as a function of time to formalin fixation. A tissue microarray consisting of 93 breast cancer specimens with documented time-to-fixation was used to evaluate changes in antigenicity of 12 phosphoepitopes frequently used in research settings as a function of cold ischemic time. Analysis was performed in a quantitative manner using the AQUA technology for quantitative immunofluorescence. For each marker, least squares univariate linear regression was performed and confidence intervals were computed using bootstrapping. The majority of the epitopes tested revealed changes in expression levels with increasing time to formalin fixation. Some phosphorylated proteins, such as phospho-HSP27 and phospho-S6 RP, involved in post-translational modification and stress response pathways increased in expression or phosphorylation levels. Others (like phospho-AKT, phosphor-ERK1/2, phospho-Tyrosine, phospho-MET, and others) are quite labile and loss of antigenicity can be reported within 1-2 h of cold ischemic time. Therefore specimen collection should be closely monitored and subjected to quality control measures to ensure accurate measurement of these epitopes. However, a few phosphoepitopes (like phospho-JAK2 and phospho-ER) are sufficiently robust for routine usage in companion diagnostic testing.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 24

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous entity with remarkably variable clinical outcome. Gene expression profiling (GEP) classifies DLBCL into activated B-cell like (ABC), germinal center B-cell like (GCB), and Type-III subtypes, with ABC-DLBCL characterized by a poor prognosis and constitutive NF-κB activation. A major challenge for the application of this cell of origin (COO) classification in routine clinical practice is to establish a robust clinical assay amenable to routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic biopsies. In this study, we investigated the possibility of COO-classification using FFPE tissue RNA samples by massive parallel quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). We established a protocol for parallel qRT-PCR using FFPE RNA samples with the Fluidigm BioMark HD system, and quantified the expression of the COO classifier genes and the NF-κB targeted-genes that characterize ABC-DLBCL in 143 cases of DLBCL. We also trained and validated a series of basic machine-learning classifiers and their derived meta classifiers, and identified SimpleLogistic as the top classifier that gave excellent performance across various GEP data sets derived from fresh-frozen or FFPE tissues by different microarray platforms. Finally, we applied SimpleLogistic to our data set generated by qRT-PCR, and the ABC and GCB-DLBCL assigned showed the respective characteristics in their clinical outcome and NF-κB target gene expression. The methodology established in this study provides a robust approach for DLBCL sub-classification using routine FFPE diagnostic biopsies in a routine clinical setting.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 24 November 2014; doi:10.1038/labinvest.2014.136.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression","uri":{"id":"D015870","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma, B-Cell","uri":{"id":"D016393","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Targeting","uri":{"id":"D018390","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Expression Profiling","uri":{"id":"D020869","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transcriptome","uri":{"id":"D059467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germinal Center","uri":{"id":"D018858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reverse Transcription","uri":{"id":"D048348","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"B-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D001402","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biopsy","uri":{"id":"D001706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lymphoma","uri":{"id":"D008223","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prognosis","uri":{"id":"D011379","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA","uri":{"id":"D012313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germination","uri":{"id":"D018525","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25418578","title":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: sub-classification by massive parallel quantitative RT-PCR.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Early detection by skin self-examination (SSE) could improve outcomes from melanoma. Mobile teledermoscopy may aid this process. OBJECTIVES: To establish clinical accuracy of SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy compared to clinical skin examination (CSE) and test whether providing people with detailed SSE instructions improves accuracy. METHODS: Men and women 50-64 years (n=58) performed SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy in their homes between May and November 2013 and were given technical instructions plus detailed SSE instructions (intervention) or technical instructions only (control). Within three months, they underwent a CSE. Outcome measures included: a) body sites examined, lesions photographed, and missed; b) sensitivityof SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy compared to in-person CSE using either patients or lesions as denominator; and, c) concordance of telediagnosis with CSE. RESULTS: 49 of 58 randomised participants completed the study, and submitted 309 lesions to the teledermatologist (156 intervention; 153 control group). Intervention group participants were more likely to submit lesions from their legs compared to control (p=0.03), no other differences between groups in number or site of missed lesions.11 participants (22%) did not photograph 14 pigmented lesions the dermatologist considered worthwhile photographing or requiring clinical monitoring. Sensitivity of SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy was 81.8% (95% confidence interval 64.5-93.0) using the patient as the denominator and 41.9 (27.6-56.2) using the lesion as denominator.-There was substantial agreement between telediagnosis and CSE (Kappa =0.90) accounting for differential diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy is promising for surveillance of particular lesions even without provision of detailed SSE instructions, but in the format tested in this study, consumers may overlook lesions and send many non-pigmented lesions. This investigation demonstrates that high quality dermoscopic images can be taken by patients at home and for those sent, telediagnosis is highly accurate. This article is protected by copyright.

Design: Test-retest study. Subjects: A total of 30 adults with neurological diseases including: Parkinson's disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Cervical Dystonia; and Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Method: The S-ESES was sent twice by surface mail. Completion interval mean was 16 days apart. Weighted kappa, intraclass correlation coefficient 2,1 [ICC (2,1)], standard error of measurement (SEM), also expressed as a percentage value (SEM%), and Cronbach's alpha were calculated. Results: The relative reliability of the test-retest results showed substantial agreement measured using weighted kappa (MD = 0.62) and a very high-reliability ICC (2,1) (0.92). Absolute reliability measured using SEM was 5.3 and SEM% was 20.7. Excellent internal consistency was shown, with an alpha coefficient of 0.91 (test 1) and 0.93 (test 2). Conclusion: The S-ESES is recommended for use in research and in clinical work for people with neurological diseases.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate uptake and utilization of boceprevir and telaprevir in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We evaluated whether therapies conformed to response-guided protocols, whether they replaced standard interferon plus ribavirin treatment, and whether IL-28B was used to guide treatment. We performed an administrative data-based analysis of all patients receiving pharmacologic treatment for HCV in VA from October 2009 to July 2013. There were 12 737 new HCV prescriptions in VA during this time, with 5564 boceprevir or telaprevir prescriptions (44%) and 7173 prescriptions (56%) written for standard interferon plus ribavirin treatment. Prescriptions for the new treatments heavily favoured boceprevir vs telaprevir (83% vs 17%). Sixty-two percent (62%) of boceprevir-treated patients completed their minimum-specified protocol, while 69.2% of telaprevir-treated patients completed their minimum-specified protocol. From October 2010 to July 2012, 4090 patients had an IL-28B test; less than 16% of these tests guided subsequent HCV prescriptions. Uptake of boceprevir and telaprevir was rapid; the number of patients initiating treatment approximately doubled in the period after their introduction. While new prescriptions favor boceprevir or telaprevir over standard interferon plus ribavirin therapy, there appears to still be a strong role of interferon plus ribavirin in treating HCV patients. This work can inform our understanding of how other new effective HCV therapies will be used, their diffusion, and the timing of their diffusion in actual clinical practice.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of viral hepatitis","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis Viruses","uri":{"id":"D006518","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Drug Therapy","uri":{"id":"D004358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis C","uri":{"id":"D006526","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepacivirus","uri":{"id":"D016174","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antiviral Agents","uri":{"id":"D000998","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diffusion","uri":{"id":"D004058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis","uri":{"id":"D006505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interferons","uri":{"id":"D007372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ribavirin","uri":{"id":"D012254","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Veterans","uri":{"id":"D014728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Viruses","uri":{"id":"D014780","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prescriptions","uri":{"id":"D055656","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417805","title":"Uptake and utilization of directly acting antiviral medications for hepatitis C infection in U.S. veterans.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Parallel processing of regional anesthesia may improve operating room (OR) efficiency in patients undergoes upper extremity surgical procedures. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether performing regional anesthesia outside the OR in parallel increases total cases per day, improve efficiency and productivity. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Data from all adult patients who underwent regional anesthesia as their primary anesthetic for upper extremity surgery over a one-year period were used to develop a simulation model. The model evaluated pure operating modes of regional anesthesia performed within and outside the OR in a parallel manner. The scenarios were used to evaluate how many surgeries could be completed in a standard work day (555 minutes) and assuming a standard three cases per day, what was the predicted end-of-day time overtime. FINDINGS: Modeling results show that parallel processing of regional anesthesia increases the average cases per day for all surgeons included in the study. The average increase was 0.42 surgeries per day. Where it was assumed that three cases per day would be performed by all surgeons, the days going to overtime was reduced by 43 percent with parallel block. The overtime with parallel anesthesia was also projected to be 40 minutes less per day per surgeon. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Key limitations include the assumption that all cases used regional anesthesia in the comparisons. Many days may have both regional and general anesthesia. Also, as a case study, single-center research may limit generalizability. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Perioperative care providers should consider parallel administration of regional anesthesia where there is a desire to increase daily upper extremity surgical case capacity. Where there are sufficient resources to do parallel anesthesia processing, efficiency and productivity can be significantly improved. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Simulation modeling can be an effective tool to show practice change effects at a system-wide level.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of health care quality assurance","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ambulatory Surgical Procedures","uri":{"id":"D000556","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anesthesia, General","uri":{"id":"D000768","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Operating Rooms","uri":{"id":"D009873","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anesthesia, Conduction","uri":{"id":"D000765","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perioperative Care","uri":{"id":"D019990","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Upper Extremity","uri":{"id":"D034941","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anesthesia","uri":{"id":"D000758","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Extremities","uri":{"id":"D005121","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anesthetics","uri":{"id":"D000777","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417375","title":"Improving operating room productivity via parallel anesthesia processing.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The probability of cure is a long-term prognostic measure of cancer survival. Estimates of the cure fraction, the proportion of patients \"cured\" of the disease, are based on extrapolating survival models beyond the range of data. The objective of this work is to evaluate the sensitivity of cure fraction estimates to model choice and study design. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-9 registries to construct a cohort of breast and colorectal cancer patients diagnosed from 1975 to 1985. In a sensitivity analysis, cure fraction estimates are compared from different study designs with short- and long-term follow-up. Methods tested include: cause-specific and relative survival, parametric mixture, and flexible models. In a separate analysis, estimates are projected for 2008 diagnoses using study designs including the full cohort (1975-2008 diagnoses) and restricted to recent diagnoses (1998-2008) with follow-up to 2009. RESULTS: We show that flexible models often provide higher estimates of the cure fraction compared to parametric mixture models. Log normal models generate lower estimates than Weibull parametric models. In general, 12 years is enough follow-up time to estimate the cure fraction for regional and distant stage colorectal cancer but not for breast cancer. 2008 colorectal cure projections show a 15% increase in the cure fraction since 1985. DISCUSSION: Estimates of the cure fraction are model and study design dependent. It is best to compare results from multiple models and examine model fit to determine the reliability of the estimate. Early-stage cancers are sensitive to survival type and follow-up time because of their longer survival. More flexible models are susceptible to slight fluctuations in the shape of the survival curve which can influence the stability of the estimate; however, stability may be improved by lengthening follow-up and restricting the cohort to reduce heterogeneity in the data.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a scale of exercise difficulty and has been hypothesized to be a regulator of work rate during self-pacing. The goal of this work was to develop a dynamic prediction of RPE and to characterize the control strategy employed to reduce work rate during self-paced exercise using RPE as feedback. METHODS: Training and test data were acquired from the literature to develop a linear regression of RPE as a function of four physiological variables: core temperature, mean-weighted skin temperature, metabolic rate, and integral of relative oxygen consumption (R (2) = 0.85). A thermoregulatory model was used to predict core and mean-weighted skin temperature. Utilizing self-paced cycling and running data from the literature, we characterized reductions in work rate with a proportional-derivative control algorithm with RPE as feedback. RESULTS: Bland-Altman analysis revealed the necessity to parameterize RPE equations for untrained and endurance-trained individuals. Afterwards, dynamic predictions of RPE were accurate for a wide range of activity levels and air temperatures for walking, running, and cycling (LoA and bias of 2.3 and -0.03, respectively). For self-paced exercise, the control algorithm characterized the trend and magnitude of work rate reductions for cycling and running, and showed regulated RPE to be less conservative for shorter vs. longer duration exercise. CONCLUSIONS: A novel methodology to characterize self-paced work intensity, based upon dynamic physiologic response, is provided. The complete model is a useful tool that estimates performance decrements during self-paced exercise and predicts tolerance time for exhaustive fixed-rate exercise.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"European journal of applied physiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Skin Temperature","uri":{"id":"D012881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygen Consumption","uri":{"id":"D010101","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Skin Temperature","uri":{"id":"D012881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Linear Models","uri":{"id":"D016014","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Algorithms","uri":{"id":"D000465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Feedback","uri":{"id":"D005246","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygen","uri":{"id":"D010100","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oxygenators","uri":{"id":"D010106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temperature","uri":{"id":"D013696","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise","uri":{"id":"D015444","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bias (Epidemiology)","uri":{"id":"D015982","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Loa","uri":{"id":"D008117","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417169","title":"Prediction of performance reduction in self-paced exercise as modulated by the rating of perceived exertion.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is widely used in biomedical research to assess the reproducibility of measurements between raters, labs, technicians, or devices. For example, in an inter-rater reliability study, a high ICC value means that noise variability (between-raters and within-raters) is small relative to variability from patient to patient. A confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval for the ICC is a commonly reported summary. Such intervals can be constructed employing either frequentist or Bayesian methodologies. METHODS: This study examines the performance of three different methods for constructing an interval in a two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction: the Generalized Confidence Interval method (GCI), the Modified Large Sample method (MLS), and a Bayesian method based on a noninformative prior distribution (NIB). Guidance is provided on interval construction method selection based on study design, sample size, and normality of the data. We compare the coverage probabilities and widths of the different interval methods. RESULTS: We show that, for the two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction, care is needed in interval method selection because the interval estimates do not always have properties that the user expects. While different methods generally perform well when there are a large number of levels of each factor, large differences between the methods emerge when the number of one or more factors is limited. In addition, all methods are shown to lack robustness to certain hard-to-detect violations of normality when the sample size is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Decision rules and software programs for interval construction are provided for practical implementation in the two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction. All interval methods perform similarly when the data are normal and there are sufficient numbers of levels of each factor.

Partnership research models are useful for achieving the integration of CCS and EBP, since they involve close observation of and participation by clinicians and practitioners in the research process, and often use integrated qualitative and quantitative mixed methods. We illustrate this with 3 examples of work that can help integrate CCS and EBP: ongoing collection of information from patients, clinicians and staff, or \"evidence farming\"; close study and continuous improvement of activities and accommodations; and use of evidence of tacit, implicit cultural scripts and norms, such as being \"productive,\" as well as explicit scripts.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: Massive rotator cuff tears (MRCT) are usually chronic lesions that present associated degenerative changes of the myotendinous unit that have been implicated in limitations for surgical repair. In order to develop effective therapies, it is important to establish animal models that mimic the hallmarks of the injury itself. Therefore, in the present work, we aimed to (1) optimize a rodent animal model of MRCT that closely reproduces the fatty infiltration of the cuff muscles seen in humans and (2) describe the effects of unilateral or bilateral lesion in terms of histology and behaviour. METHODS: Massive tear was defined as two rotator cuff tendons-supraspinatus and infraspinatus-section. Twenty-one Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: bilateral lesion (five animals), right-sided unilateral lesion (five animals), left-sided unilateral lesion (five animals) and control (six animals). Behaviour was analyzed with open field and staircase test, 16 weeks after lesion. After that, animals were killed, and the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles were processed. RESULTS: Histologic analysis revealed adipocytes, fatty infiltration and atrophy in the injured side with a greater consistency of these degenerative changes in the bilateral lesion group. Behaviour analysis revealed a significant functional impairment of the fine motor control of the forepaw analyzed in staircase test where the number of eaten pellets was significantly higher in sham animals (sham = 7 ± 5.0; left unilateral = 2.6 ± 3.0; right unilateral = 0 ± 0; and bilateral = 0 ± 0, p < 0.05). A trend to reach a lower level of steps, in more injured animals, was also observed (sham animals = 3 ± 1.6 > left unilateral = 2 ± 2.1 > right unilateral = 0.8 ± 1.3 > bilateral = 0.8 ± 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has been able to establish an animal model that disclosed the hallmarks of MRCT. This can now be used as a valuable, cost-effective, pre-clinical instrument to assist in the development of advanced tissue engineered strategies. Moreover, this animal model overcomes some of the limitations of those that have been reported so far and thus represents a more reliable source for the assessment of future therapeutic strategies with potential clinical relevance.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rats, Wistar","uri":{"id":"D017208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Animal","uri":{"id":"D023421","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Engineering","uri":{"id":"D023822","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Atrophy","uri":{"id":"D001284","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Histology","uri":{"id":"D006653","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Homicide","uri":{"id":"D006708","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Muscles","uri":{"id":"D009132","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rodentia","uri":{"id":"D012377","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rotation","uri":{"id":"D012399","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rotator Cuff","uri":{"id":"D017006","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adipocytes","uri":{"id":"D017667","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416674","title":"Animal model for chronic massive rotator cuff tear: behavioural and histologic analysis.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to develop diagnostic tests to improve the detection of pathogens causing life-threatening infection (sepsis). SeptiFast is a CE-marked multi-pathogen real-time PCR system capable of detecting DNA sequences of bacteria and fungi present in blood samples within a few hours. We report here a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of SeptiFast in the setting of suspected sepsis. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify studies that compared SeptiFast with blood culture in suspected sepsis. Methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS. Heterogeneity of studies was investigated using a coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity and a scatter plot in receiver operator characteristic space. Bivariate model method was used to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: From 41 phase III diagnostic accuracy studies, summary sensitivity and specificity for SeptiFast compared with blood culture were 0.68 (95 % CI 0.63-0.73) and 0.86 (95 % CI 0.84-0.89) respectively. Study quality was judged to be variable with important deficiencies overall in design and reporting that could impact on derived diagnostic accuracy metrics. CONCLUSIONS: SeptiFast appears to have higher specificity than sensitivity, but deficiencies in study quality are likely to render this body of work unreliable. Based on the evidence presented here, it remains difficult to make firm recommendations about the likely clinical utility of SeptiFast in the setting of suspected sepsis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Intensive care medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computer Systems","uri":{"id":"D003199","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"ROC Curve","uri":{"id":"D012372","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D060888","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Base Sequence","uri":{"id":"D001483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnostic Tests, Routine","uri":{"id":"D003955","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sequence Analysis, DNA","uri":{"id":"D017422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bacteria","uri":{"id":"D001419","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sensitivity and Specificity","uri":{"id":"D012680","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Trees","uri":{"id":"D014197","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymerase Chain Reaction","uri":{"id":"D016133","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sepsis","uri":{"id":"D018805","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416643","title":"Accuracy of LightCycler(®) SeptiFast for the detection and identification of pathogens in the blood of patients with suspected sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The growing number of primary care physicians (PCPs) reducing their clinical work hours has raised concerns about meeting the future demand for services and fulfilling the continuity and access mandates for patient-centered care. However, the patient's experience of care with part-time physicians is relatively unknown, and may be mediated by continuity and access to care outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relationships between a physicians' clinical full-time equivalent (FTE), continuity of care, access to care, and patient satisfaction with the physician. DESIGN: We used a multi-level structural equation estimation, with continuity and access modeled as mediators, for a cross-section in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: The study included family medicine (n = 104) and internal medicine (n = 101) physicians in a multi-specialty group practice, along with their patient satisfaction survey responses (n = 12,688). MAIN MEASURES: Physician level FTE, continuity of care received by patients, continuity of care provided by physician, and a Press Ganey patient satisfaction with the physician score, on a 0-100 % scale, were measured. Access to care was measured as days to the third next-available appointment. KEY RESULTS: Physician FTE was directly associated with better continuity of care received (0.172 % per FTE, p < 0.001), better continuity of care provided (0.108 % per FTE, p < 0.001), and better access to care (-0.033 days per FTE, p < 0.01), but worse patient satisfaction scores (-0.080 % per FTE, p = 0.03). The continuity of care provided was a significant mediator (0.016 % per FTE, p < 0.01) of the relationship between FTE and patient satisfaction; but overall, reduced clinical work hours were associated with better patient satisfaction (-0.053 % per FTE, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PCPs who choose to work fewer clinical hours may have worse continuity and access, but they may provide a better patient experience. Physician workforce planning should consider these care attributes when considering the role of part-time PCPs in practice redesign efforts and initiatives to meet the demand for primary care services.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of general internal medicine","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Care","uri":{"id":"D005791","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutic Equivalency","uri":{"id":"D013810","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Primary Health Care","uri":{"id":"D011320","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Continuity of Patient Care","uri":{"id":"D003266","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Group Practice","uri":{"id":"D006123","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internal Medicine","uri":{"id":"D007388","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Satisfaction","uri":{"id":"D017060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient-Centered Care","uri":{"id":"D018802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians, Primary Care","uri":{"id":"D058007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicine","uri":{"id":"D008511","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physicians","uri":{"id":"D010820","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Satisfaction","uri":{"id":"D010549","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416600","title":"Patients Report Better Satisfaction with Part-Time Primary Care Physicians, Despite Less Continuity of Care and Access.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: IntroductionTriple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) represent about 12% to 20% of all breast cancers (BC) and have a worse outcome compared to other BC subtypes. TNBC often show a deficiency in DNA double-strand break repair mechanisms. This is generally related to the inactivation of a repair enzymatic complex involving BRCA1 caused either by genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications or by post-transcriptional regulations.The identification of new molecular biomarkers that would allow the rapid identification of BC presenting a BRCA1 deficiency could be useful to select patients who could benefit from PARP inhibitors, alkylating agents or platinum-based chemotherapy.MethodsGenomic DNA from 131 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors (luminal A and B, HER2+ and triple negative BC) with known BRCA1 mutation status or unscreened for BRCA1 mutation were analysed by array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH). One highly significant and recurrent gain in the 17q25.3 genomic region was analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Expression of the genes of the 17q25.3 amplicon was studied using customized Taqman low density arrays and single Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems).ResultsWe identified by array CGH and confirmed by FISH a gain in the 17q25.3 genomic region in 90% of the BRCA1 mutated tumors. This chromosomal gain was present in only 28.6% of the BRCA1 non-mutated TNBC, 26.7% of the unscreened TNBC, 13.6% of the luminal B, 19.0% of the HER2+ and 0% of the luminal A breast cancers. The 17q25.3 gain was also detected in 50% of the TNBC with BRCA1 promoter methylation. Interestingly, BRCA1 promoter methylation was never detected in BRCA1 mutated BC. Gene expression analyses of the 17q25.3 sub-region showed a significant over-expression of 17 genes in BRCA1 mutated TNBC (n¿=¿15) as compared to the BRCA1 non mutated TNBC (n¿=¿13).ConclusionsIn this study, we have identified by array CGH and confirmed by FISH a recurrent gain in 17q25.3 significantly associated to BRCA1 mutated TNBC. Up-regulated genes in the 17q25.3 amplicon might represent potential therapeutic targets and warrant further investigation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Breast cancer research :

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Impaired well-being and high work-family conflict are critical issues among GPs. This research examined an understudied psychosocial risk factor for these outcomes, namely GPs' perception that they invest more in the relationship with their patients than what they receive in return (i.e. lack of reward in their relationship with patients). OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of lack of reward as a risk factor for poor well-being and work-family conflict among GPs. METHODS: Longitudinal study (12 months time lag). 272 GPs in Switzerland [mean age 54.5 (SD = 8.3), 73% male] volunteered to participate in the study. 270 participants completed the baseline survey and 252 completed the follow-up survey. Of these, six retired between the baseline and the follow-up survey, resulting in a sample size of 246 participants at t2. Outcome measures were burnout, sleep problems, self-perceived health and work-family conflict. RESULTS: Strength and direction of prospective effects were tested using cross-lagged models. Lack of reward was related to an increase in emotional exhaustion (β = 0.15), sleep problems (β = 0.16) and work-family conflict (β = 0.19) and a decrease in self-perceived health (β = -0.17). Effects on depersonalization and personal accomplishment were not significant. Regarding reversed effects of impaired well-being on lack of reward, emotional exhaustion (β = 0.14) and self-perceived health (β = -0.13) predicted future level of lack of reward. CONCLUSION: Lack of reward by patients is a risk factor in GPs' mental health.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Family practice","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Longitudinal Studies","uri":{"id":"D008137","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sample Size","uri":{"id":"D018401","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Practitioners","uri":{"id":"D058005","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Forecasting","uri":{"id":"D005544","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Names","uri":{"id":"D009275","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Perception","uri":{"id":"D010465","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reward","uri":{"id":"D012201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Volunteers","uri":{"id":"D014838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depersonalization","uri":{"id":"D003861","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Retirement","uri":{"id":"D012179","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Switzerland","uri":{"id":"D013557","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416413","title":"When general practitioners don't feel appreciated by their patients: prospective effects on well-being and work-family conflict in a Swiss Longitudinal Study.","year":"2014"}

The findings centred on four themes: the importance of funding; collaboration, communication and coordination; the government's role; and hospital leadership buy-in. Together, these findings suggest that issues such as a lack of performance metrics, insufficient funding, inadequate surge capacity, confusing federal guidelines and accreditation requirements and an overall lack of coordination in hospitals' abilities to manage emergency incidents continue to plague the US healthcare system. Exploring and understanding these experiences can support the field in maintaining elements that work and recognising and applying solutions to its shortcomings. This is the first of two papers on the subject, providing background on the topic, the study's purpose, research design and a review of salient literature.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of tolerance to ethanol on the sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) structure. Experiments were carried out in chronic conditions on the adult cats (n=5). The following methods were used: the stereotaxic - for implanting electrodes; polysomnographic - for EEG registration of the SWC structure. Alcoholisation (0.2-2.5 g/kg 25% ethanol solution) was conducted by intraperitoneal injections that lasted for two weeks. The obtained results were processed statistically and significance of the changes was determined by the Student t-test. Low single doses of ethanol (0.2 - 0.5 g/kg) did not induce any significant changes in the structure of the SWC. While using doses of 0.6 g/kg it was noted only increasing of the latent period of the onset of sleep. However, the structure of the SWC recovered within 1-2 hours after injection. Increasing the dose to 1 g/kg caused severe intoxication. This was reflected in a behavioral (anxiety, tremor, vocalizations) and autonomic (vomiting and frequent urination) signs. Against the background of restless behavioral wakefulness synchronization of the characteristic of light slow-wave sleep developed. The volume of deep slow-wave sleep was statistically significantly decreased and the latent period of the onset of paradoxical sleep was increased. The structure of sleep was fragmented, due to frequent awakenings. For the fifth-eighth day of alcoholization the structure of the SWC restored, behavioral and vegetative signs of intoxication disappeared, which must indicate the development of tolerance to this dose of ethanol. The obtained results signify that development of tolerance to ethanol can be reflected in the alteration of the structure of SWC. Alcoholization disturbs the subtle mechanisms of the sleep due to destruction of brain homeostasis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Georgian medical news","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrodes, Implanted","uri":{"id":"D004567","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Injections, Intraperitoneal","uri":{"id":"D007274","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sleep","uri":{"id":"D012890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sleep, REM","uri":{"id":"D012895","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrodes","uri":{"id":"D004566","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Homeostasis","uri":{"id":"D006706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Students","uri":{"id":"D013334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urination","uri":{"id":"D014554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urine","uri":{"id":"D014556","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vegetables","uri":{"id":"D014675","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ethanol","uri":{"id":"D000431","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electrodes, Implanted","uri":{"id":"D004567","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electroencephalography","uri":{"id":"D004569","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychomotor Agitation","uri":{"id":"D011595","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wakefulness","uri":{"id":"D014851","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416225","title":"Reflection of tolerance to alcohol in the structure of the sleep wakefulness cycle.","year":"2014"}

Prevention interventions have been implemented in Mexico but few have been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness. This article presents the long term effects of a Mexico-based pilot study to test the feasibility of a linguistically specific (Mexican Spanish) adapted version of keepin' it REAL, a school-based substance abuse prevention model program. University affiliated researchers from Mexico and the US collaborated on the study design, program implementation, data collection, and analysis. Students and their teachers from two middle schools (secundarias) in Guadalajara participated in this field trial of Mantente REAL (translated to Spanish). The schools were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. The sample of 431 students reported last 30 day substance use at three times (one pretest and two posttests). Changes in substance use behaviors over time were examined using growth curve models. Long term desired intervention effects were found for alcohol and marijuana use but not for cigarettes. The intervention effects were greater for girls than for boys in slowing the typical developmental increase over time in alcohol use. Marijuana effects were based on small numbers of users and indicate a need for larger scale studies.

In this work, seven pretreatments, three selective isolation media, and five artificial seawater concentrations were used to isolate actinomycetes from the sediments collected from Yellow Sea, China. Statistical analysis showed that only the isolation medium strongly affected the total and bioactive numbers of actinomycete isolates. A total of 613 actinobacterial strains were isolated and screened for antimicrobial activities; 154 isolates showed activity against at least one of nine test drug-resistant microorganisms. Eighty-nine representatives with strong antimicrobial activity were identified phylogenetically based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which were assigned to five different actinomycete genera Streptomyces, Kocuria, Saccharomonospora, Micromonospora, and Nocardiopsis. Using PCR-based screening for six biosynthetic genes of secondary metabolites, all 45 isolates with acute activity have at least one biosynthetic gene, 28.8 % of which possess more than three biosynthetic genes. As a case, strain SMA-1 was selected for antimicrobial natural product discovery. Three diketopiperazine dimers including a new compound iso-naseseazine B (1) and two known compounds naseseazine B (2) and aspergilazine A (3) were isolated by bioassay-guided separation. These results suggested that actinomycetes from marine sediments are a potential resource of novel secondary metabolites and drugs.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Archives of microbiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Products","uri":{"id":"D001688","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, rRNA","uri":{"id":"D020459","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Geologic Sediments","uri":{"id":"D019015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"China","uri":{"id":"D002681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Military Personnel","uri":{"id":"D008889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seawater","uri":{"id":"D012623","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Streptomyces","uri":{"id":"D013302","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dimerization","uri":{"id":"D019281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nature","uri":{"id":"D019368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Actinobacteria","uri":{"id":"D039903","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Micromonospora","uri":{"id":"D008847","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diketopiperazines","uri":{"id":"D054659","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25416124","title":"Diversity and bioprospecting of culturable actinomycetes from marine sediment of the Yellow Sea, China.","year":"2014"}
