Exercise (planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength, gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists and consulted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that recruited community-dwelling people (where the majority were aged 65 and over) and were not restricted to specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke, hip fracture). We included trials that evaluated exercise interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise interventions were varied; for example, they could be 'prescriptions' or recommendations, group-based or individual, supervised or unsupervised. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. We combined effect sizes across studies using the fixed-effect model, with the random-effect model used where significant statistical heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where different measures or different formats of the same measure were used. Where possible, we performed various, usually prespecified, sensitivity and subgroup analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling.Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes.Exercise interventions were associated with a small to moderate reduction in fear of falling immediately post intervention (SMD 0.37 favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24 favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However, there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control.There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants).Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies that reported fear of falling. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions in community-dwelling older people probably reduce fear of falling to a limited extent immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed randomised trials is required, priority should be given to establishing a core set of outcomes that includes fear of falling for all trials examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the extent of occupational exposure to hardwood dust in certain sectors of Italian industry. Methods: Information on occupational exposures was collected from enterprise exposure registers that must by law be reported to the National Workers' Compensation Authority, as at 31 December 2011. Data stored in the database included economic activity sector, work force size and exposed workers. The number of workers potentially exposed was estimated for some of the industrial sectors from national occupational statistics in Italy. Results: The economic sector with the highest number of potentially exposed workers to hardwood dust was that classified as the manufacture of other wooden furniture with 15,760 men and 2,771 women, while the highest percentage of enterprises that had sent data (according to the ISTAT 2001 census) was in building and repair of non-metallic ships (21%).

Results: Primary SS were predominantly well-circumscribed(27/31) and heterogeneously enhancing solid(18/31) or solid-cystic(13/31) tumors. Imaging features visualized included presence of perilesional edema(14/31), interfascial(15/31) and intercompartmental extension(7/31), triple sign(11/31), intratumoral hemorrhage(10/31), calcification(6/31), bowl of grapes appearance(5/31) and bone involvement(3/31). Smaller T1 stage tumors (8/31) appeared as heterogeneously enhancing lesions, with some lesions demonstrating interfascial and intercompartmental extension and perilesional edema. Recurrent/ metastatic disease developed in 49/78(63%) patients. Of these, 20/78(26%) had metastasis at presentation, while the remaining developed metastatic disease at a median interval of 27 months(range: 3-161 months). Pleuropulmonary metastases (46/78) were the most common sites, with most of the metastases being pleural-based. On univariate analysis,larger tumor size, presence of perilesional edema, intercompartmental extension, presence of intralesional hemorrhage and bowl of grapes appearance on MRI were associated with a significantly higher incidence of metastatic disease. Conclusions: Certain imaging features of primary SS predict the risk of development of metastatic disease. Imaging features of T1 stage tumors included heterogeneous enhancement, interfascial extension and perilesional edema. Pleural-based metastases are commonly seen in SS. Advances in knowledge: Imaging features of primary SS correlate with metastatic disease.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disorder which involves the activation of immune system against the self-tissues. The main targets of this disease are the joints. Being systemic the development of this disease involves different mechanisms and thus the exact cause of this disease remains unknown. Although different drugs have been developed, none has been found to be the cure for this disease. In the current study the rat carrageenin paw was used as a model for acute inflammation and mycobacterium induced adjuvant arthritic model was used for exploring the antiarthritic potential of methanolic extract of Gentiana kurroo. In this study the different extracts tested showed less inhibition of acute inflammation than methanolic extract. The methanolic extract was further used in different doses and the anti-inflammatory efficacy was found to be dose dependent. The results obtained were significant with the control and the standard groups.

Structural variability in the lower axial ligand has been observed in cobamides produced by diverse organisms. Of the three classes of lower ligands, the benzimidazoles are uniquely found in cobamides, whereas the purine and phenolic bases have additional biological functions. Many organisms acquire cobamides by salvaging and remodeling cobamides or their precursors from the environment. These processes require free benzimidazoles for incorporation as lower ligands, though the presence of benzimidazoles in the environment has not been previously investigated. Here, we report a new purification method and bioassay to measure the total free benzimidazole content of samples from microbial communities and laboratory media components. The bioassay relies on the \"calcofluor-bright\" phenotype of a bluB mutant of the model cobalamin-producing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The concentrations of individual benzimidazoles in these samples were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Several benzimidazoles were detected in subpicomolar to subnanomolar concentrations in host-associated and environmental samples. In addition, benzimidazoles were found to be common contaminants of laboratory media components. These results suggest that benzimidazoles present in the environment and in laboratory media have the potential to influence microbial metabolic activities.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Frontiers in microbiology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mass Spectrometry","uri":{"id":"D013058","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biotransformation","uri":{"id":"D001711","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coenzymes","uri":{"id":"D003067","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitamin B 12","uri":{"id":"D014805","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sinorhizobium meliloti","uri":{"id":"D016962","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Benzimidazoles","uri":{"id":"D001562","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Assay","uri":{"id":"D001681","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Laboratories","uri":{"id":"D007753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ligands","uri":{"id":"D008024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Metabolism","uri":{"id":"D008660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrum Analysis","uri":{"id":"D013057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitamins","uri":{"id":"D014815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Autonomy","uri":{"id":"D026684","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cobamides","uri":{"id":"D003038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Purines","uri":{"id":"D011687","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vitamin B 12","uri":{"id":"D014805","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sinorhizobium","uri":{"id":"D020579","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431570","title":"A bioassay for the detection of benzimidazoles reveals their presence in a range of environmental samples.","year":"2014"}

We compared the disease control with protocolized treatment adjustment following a tight control strategy utilizing either the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) or the CDAI. METHODS: In a prospective 12 month study, DMARD-naive RA patients were randomized to either a CDAI or SDAI arm and were treated with traditional DMARDs, increased on a monthly basis according to a predefined protocol to achieve low disease activity. RESULTS: Of 102 patients (84 females, 96 Black Africans), the mean symptom duration was 3.0 years (s.d. 3.8) and the mean 28-joint DAS (DAS28) at baseline was 6.2 (s.d. 1.2). By 12 months, the proportion of patients in the CDAI and SDAI groups achieving low disease activity (30% and 32%) and remission (33 and 34%) were similar. There were no significant differences in the mean DAS28 or its components or in HAQ Disability Index or health-related quality of life scores. Baseline predictors of low disease activity at 12 months were shorter symptom duration (P = 0.03) and lower HAQ-DI score (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Given that the CDAI performed as well as the SDAI, and considering the cost savings and convenience because no acute phase reactant test is necessary, we suggest the CDAI may be an appropriate tool for monthly disease activity monitoring as part of a tight control strategy in developing countries.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ambulatory Care Facilities","uri":{"id":"D000554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acute-Phase Proteins","uri":{"id":"D000209","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developing Countries","uri":{"id":"D003906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality of Life","uri":{"id":"D011788","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developed Countries","uri":{"id":"D019049","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Clinical Protocols","uri":{"id":"D002985","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D009800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cost Savings","uri":{"id":"D017046","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Income","uri":{"id":"D007182","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044383","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431484","title":"Tight control of rheumatoid arthritis in a resource-constrained setting: a randomized controlled study comparing the clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2005-2010 data from a US commercial health plan. Eligible patients had two or more physician diagnoses of RA during a baseline period of at least 180 days with continuous medical and pharmacy coverage. We computed age-adjusted incidence rates of MI and IS, and used spline regression to assess non-linear associations and Cox-regression to quantify the independent association between the laboratory values and the outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 44 418 eligible RA patients (mean age 49 years; 76% women). CRP>10 mg/L compared with <1 mg/L was associated with increased MI risk (HR 2.12; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.38). ESR>42 mm/h compared with <14 mm/h was associated with increased risk of MI (HR 2.53; 95% CI 1.48 to 4.31) and IS (HR 2.51; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.75) risk. HDL-cholesterol ≥60 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L) compared with <40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) was associated with reduced MI risk (HR 0.37; 0.21 to 0.66). The association between LDL and MI was not linear; the lowest risk was observed among patients with LDL between 70 mg/L (1.8 mmol/L) and 100 mg/L (2.6 mmol/L). We did not observe a significant association between LDL and IS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that RA-related systemic inflammation plays a role in determining cardiovascular risk and a complex relationship between LDL and cardiovascular risk.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Postgraduate medical

In the IMPROVED study, patients with early RA (2010 criteria) and UA were initially treated with methotrexate and prednisone aiming at remission. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess the discriminative value of the model to predict damage progression in the IMPROVED population. Four hundred thirty-one out of 479 patients with RA and 106/122 with UA could be categorized as high, intermediate, low, or very low risk for RRP.

The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve was 0.56 (95% CI 0.45; 0.68). A matrix model predicting RRP based on risk factors identified in recent onset active RA according to the 1987-criteria performed poorly in recent onset RA (2010 criteria) and UA.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Circulating adiponectin has been associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Genome-wide association studies have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adiponectin levels. However, it is unclear whether these SNPs are associated with CRC risk. In addition, previous data on SNPs in the adiponectin pathway and their associations with CRC are inconsistent. Therefore, we examined 19 SNPs in genes related to adiponectin or its receptors and their associations with CRC using logistic regression among 7,020 cases and 7,631 controls drawn from 10 studies included in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Using data from a subset of two large cohort studies, we also assessed the contribution of individual SNPs and an adiponectin genetic score to plasma adiponectin after accounting for lifestyle factors among 2,217 women and 619 men. We did not find any statistically significant association between the 19 adiponectin-associated SNPs and CRC risk (multivariable-adjusted odds ratios ranged from 0.89 to 1.05, all P > 0.05). Each SNP explained less than 2.50% of the variance of plasma adiponectin, and the genetic score collectively accounted for 2.95% and 1.42% of the variability of adiponectin in women and men, respectively, after adjustment for age, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and postmenopausal hormone use. In conclusion, our findings do not support an association between known adiponectin-related common SNPs and CRC incidence. However, known common SNPs account for only a limited proportion of the interindividual variance in circulating adiponectin.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Post-adolescence is known to be a period of general maturation and development in the human brain. In brain imaging, volumetric and morphologic cortical grey-matter changes can easily be assessed, but the analysis of cortical complexity seems to have been broadly neglected for this age interval. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to acquire structural brain images. The study involved 17 adolescents (mean age 14.1 +/- 0.27, 11 girls) who were compared with 14 young adults (mean age 24.24 +/- 2.76, 7 women) for measures of brain complexity (fractal dimension - FD), grey matter (GM) volume and surface-area of cortical ribbon. FD was calculated using box-counting and Minkowski-Bouligand methods; FD and GM volume were measured for the whole brain, each hemisphere and lobes: frontal, occipital, parietal and temporal. RESULTS: The results show that the adults have a lower cortical complexity than the adolescents, which was significant for whole brain, left and right hemisphere, frontal and parietal lobes for both genders; and only for males in left temporal lobe. The GM volume was smaller in men than in boys for almost all measurements, and smaller in women than in girls just for right parietal lobe. A significant Pearson correlation was found between FD and GM volume for whole brain and each hemisphere in both genders. The decrease of the GM surface-area was significant in post-adolescence for males, not for females. CONCLUSIONS: During post-adolescence there are common changes in cortical complexity in the same regions for both genders, but there are also gender specific changes in some cortical areas. The sex differences from different cortical measurements (FD, GM volume and surface-area of cortical ribbon) could suggest a maturation delay in specific brain regions for each gender in relation to the other and might be explained through the functional role of the corresponding regions reflected in gender difference of developed abilities.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Behavioral and brain functions : BBF","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Occipital Lobe","uri":{"id":"D009778","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Young Adult","uri":{"id":"D055815","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Frontal Lobe","uri":{"id":"D005625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parietal Lobe","uri":{"id":"D010296","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sex Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Temporal Lobe","uri":{"id":"D013702","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neuroimaging","uri":{"id":"D059906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fractals","uri":{"id":"D017709","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rabeprazole","uri":{"id":"D064750","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431294","title":"Post-adolescent developmental changes in cortical complexity.","year":"2014"}

Using Turkish twins will contribute to our understanding of health problems in the context of cultural differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 309 twin pairs (339 males and 279 females) aged between 15 and 45 years living in the Kırıkkale and Ankara regions of Turkey, and administered a health and lifestyle interview that included questions about smoking status and smoking history. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics, t-tests, chi-square tests, and bivariate and multivariate clustered logistic regression. In addition, we fit bivariate Structural Equation Models (SEM) to determine contributions of latent genetic and environmental factors to smoking outcomes in this sample. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight participants (28.8%) were identified as smokers, smoking every day for a month or longer, of whom 79.2% were males and 20.8% were females. Mean values for number of cigarettes per day and the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND; Fagerstrom, 1978) score were higher in males than in females, and age of onset was earlier in males. There was a significant positive correlation between the FTND score and number of cigarettes smoked per day, and a significant negative correlation between both variables and age at onset of smoking. Our study showed that gender, presence of a smoking twin in the family, age, alcohol use, marital status, daily sports activities, and feeling moody all played a significant role in smoking behavior among twins. The twin analysis suggested that 79.5% of the liability to FTND was influenced by genetic factors and 20.5% by unique environment, while familial resemblance for smoking initiation was best explained by common environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Marked differences in the prevalence of smoking behavior in men versus women were observed for the Turkish population. Genetic analyses showed that common environmental factors primarily contributed to smoking initiation, while genetic factors explained a greater proportion of variance in liability to nicotine dependence. Our study shows higher heritability estimate of the FTND scores and higher shared environmental influence on smoking initiation for both males and females than reported in previous studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Structural","uri":{"id":"D008961","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chi-Square Distribution","uri":{"id":"D016009","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age of Onset","uri":{"id":"D017668","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Smoking","uri":{"id":"D012907","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Disorder","uri":{"id":"D014029","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Marital Status","uri":{"id":"D017533","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Culture","uri":{"id":"D003469","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emotions","uri":{"id":"D004644","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Environment","uri":{"id":"D004777","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Foundations","uri":{"id":"D005582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life Style","uri":{"id":"D008019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sports","uri":{"id":"D013177","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cluster Analysis","uri":{"id":"D016000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Living Wills","uri":{"id":"D016224","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Niacin","uri":{"id":"D009525","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nicotine","uri":{"id":"D009538","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Products","uri":{"id":"D062789","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25431287","title":"Risk factors influencing smoking behavior: a Turkish twin study.","year":"2014"}

METHODS: In this phase IIb study, 301 patients were randomised 2:1:1:1:1 to receive once daily doses of placebo or 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg baricitinib for 12 weeks. Patients assigned to 2, 4 and 8 mg baricitinib continued blinded treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Patients assigned to placebo or 1 mg baricitinib were reassigned to 2 mg twice daily or 4 mg once daily baricitinib between weeks 12-24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the combined 4 and 8 mg groups achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response versus placebo at week 12. RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the combined baricitinib 4 and 8 mg groups compared with placebo achieved an ACR20 response at week 12 (76% vs 41%, p<0.001). At week 12, significant differences versus placebo were also observed in patients achieving ACR50, ACR70 and remission as measured by Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts, Clinical Disease Activity Index and Simplified Disease Activity Index. Patients receiving 2, 4, or 8 mg baricitinib maintained or improved in all measures through 24 weeks. Similar proportions of patients experienced at least one adverse event in the placebo and baricitinib groups. Serious infections developed in three patients receiving baricitinib. No cases of tuberculosis, herpes zoster, opportunistic infections or deaths were reported. Dose-dependent decreases in haemoglobin were observed with baricitinib. CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib improved the signs and symptoms of RA in methotrexate inadequate responders with active disease.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Our aim is to study the behavior of memory Th cells (Th17, Th17/1, and Th1 profiles) from early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) patients after their in vitro activation/expansion to provide information about its contribution to RA chronicity. Moreover, we analyzed the potential involvement of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as an endogenous healing mediator. CD4(+)CD45RO(+) T cells from PBMCs of HD and eRA were activated/expanded in vitro in the presence/absence of VIP. FACS, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry analyses were performed. An increase in CCR6(+)/RORC(+) cells and in RORC-proliferating cells and a decrease in T-bet-proliferating cells and T-bet(+)/RORC(+) cells were shown in eRA. mRNA expression of IL-17, IL-2, RORC, RORA, STAT3, and Tbx21 and protein secretion of IL-17, IFNγ, and GM-CSF were higher in eRA. VIP decreased the mRNA expression of IL-22, IL-2, STAT3, Tbx21, IL-12Rβ2, IL-23R, and IL-21R in HD and it decreased IL-21, IL-2, and STAT3 in eRA. VIP decreased IL-22 and GM-CSF secretion and increased IL-9 secretion in HD and it decreased IL-21 secretion in eRA. VPAC2/VPAC1 ratio expression was increased in eRA. All in all, memory Th cells from eRA patients show a greater proportion of Th17 cells with a pathogenic Th17 and Th17/1 profile compared to HD. VIP is able to modulate the pathogenic profile, mostly in HD. Our results are promising for therapy in the early stages of RA because they suggest that targeting molecules involved in the pathogenic Th17, Th17/1, and Th1 phenotypes and targeting VIP receptors could have a therapeutic effect modulating these subsets. KEY MESSAGES: Th17 cells are more important than Th1 in the contribution to pathogenesis in eRA patients. Pathogenic Th17 and Th17/1 profile are abundant in activated/expanded memory Th cells from eRA patients. VIP decreases the pathogenic Th17, Th1, and Th17/1 profiles, mainly in healthy donors. The expression of VIP receptors is reduced in eRA patients respect to healthy donors, whereas the ratio of VPAC2/VPAC1 expression is higher.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Human Activities","uri":{"id":"D006802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide","uri":{"id":"D014660","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide","uri":{"id":"D018005","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Th17 Cells","uri":{"id":"D058504","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","uri":{"id":"D004797","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunohistochemistry","uri":{"id":"D007150","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intestines","uri":{"id":"D007422","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Therapeutics","uri":{"id":"D013812","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Donors","uri":{"id":"D014019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Virulence","uri":{"id":"D014774","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interleukin-17","uri":{"id":"D020381","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interleukin-2","uri":{"id":"D007376","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor","uri":{"id":"D016178","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interleukin-9","uri":{"id":"D016906","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25430993","title":"The pathogenic Th profile of human activated memory Th cells in early rheumatoid arthritis can be modulated by VIP.","year":"2014"}

MATERIALS AND RESULTS: Soluble interleukin 2 receptor titres (median 1500 U/ml) in 40 patients with MTX-BLPD were lower than those of 24 RA patients with non-MTX- associated (non-MTX) BLPD (5731 U/ml) and 15 with control diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 5918 U/ml) (P<0.01). By in situ hybridisation, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in tumour cells of 25 in 40 RA patients with MTX-BLPD (63%). Immunohistologically, BCL2 expression was detected in 35% of patients with MTX-BLPD, which was lower than 93% of control DLBCL patients (P<0.01). Eleven patients with EBV-positive MTX-BLPD (44%) showed remission after MTX withdrawal. In RA patients with clinical stage III/IV BLPD, 15 with rituximab (R)-plus cytotoxic therapies pursued better prognosis than 10 with R-minus cytotoxic therapies (P<0.05). Among the 15 patients, seven with MTX-BLPD showed better overall survival than nine control DLBCL patients (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In RA patients with MTX-BLPD, immunosuppression by MTX, EBV infection and low BCL2 expression in tumour cells may play roles in tumourigenesis and tumour regression.

In particular, ocular involvement may lead to inflammatory corneal ulceration, in which therapy is challenging owing to its association with systemic vasculitis. Close collaboration between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists is paramount in providing the best treatment approach in this sight-threatening condition. Case Report We present a case of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis associated with corneal melting in the absence of other typical clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis flare. The rheumatoid arthritis-associated corneal ulcer was complicated in our case by concomitant infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated with intravenous vancomycin after an initial antimicrobial ophthalmic solution proved not to be making adequate improvement in the corneal healing. The recurrent corneal melting appeared to be aggravated by the ophthalmic infection while on immunosuppressive regimen. Conclusions In patients on biologic agents, intravenous antibiotics must be considered in addition to ophthalmic eye solution in controlling the infectious process.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are commonly treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sometimes with a concomitant gastroprotective proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The present study examines real-life patient adherence to PPIs when coprescribed with NSAIDs. METHODS: This retrospective medical record survey identified patients diagnosed with OA, RA, or AS who had PPIs coprescribed with NSAIDs for prevention of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal ulcers. Actual NSAID and PPI intake was retrospectively recorded using a self-reported questionnaire. Adherence to PPI treatment was assessed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: In total, 96 patients (69% female, mean age 67 years, 72% OA, 16% RA, 12% AS) were included. The mean patient-reported adherence to coprescribed PPIs was 73%-81%. The percentage of patients with a self-reported adherence of ≤80% was 26%. No predictive factors for low adherence could be identified. CONCLUSION: Despite doctors' instructions to use PPIs concomitantly with NSAIDs, the mean patient-reported adherence to coprescribed PPIs in this population indicates a risk of a \"gastroprotective treatment gap\". The patients' adherence to gastroprotective PPIs for the prevention of NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal ulcers can be improved.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Patient preference and adherence","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Population Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D011154","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medical Records","uri":{"id":"D008499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spondylitis, Ankylosing","uri":{"id":"D013167","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proton Pumps","uri":{"id":"D017494","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Compliance","uri":{"id":"D010349","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proton Pump Inhibitors","uri":{"id":"D054328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ankylosis","uri":{"id":"D000844","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents","uri":{"id":"D000893","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protons","uri":{"id":"D011522","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spondylitis","uri":{"id":"D013166","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Ulcer","uri":{"id":"D014456","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal","uri":{"id":"D000894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Osteoarthritis","uri":{"id":"D010003","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25429206","title":"Patient-reported adherence to coprescribed proton pump inhibitor gastroprotection in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: In the USA, binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of ~3.5 % in adult women, 2.0 % in adult men, and 1.6 % in adolescents. BED is characterized by frequent episodes of binge eating that are accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating and result in marked psychological distress. BED is highly co-morbid with obesity and with depression and other psychiatric conditions, and it is associated with substantial role impairment. Currently, there are no US FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for BED. Animal and human studies implicate underlying dysregulation in dopamine, opioid, acetylcholine, and serotonin neurocircuitry within brain reward regions in the pathogenesis and maintenance of BED. To date, the efficacy of various agents that target these and other neurotransmitter systems involved in motivated feeding behavior, mood regulation, and impulse control have been investigated in the treatment of BED. Several antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents have demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating frequency, but only in limited cases have these effects resulted in patients achieving abstinence, which is the primary goal of treatment; they also range from less (fluvoxamine) to more (topiramate) effective in achieving weight loss that is both clinically meaningful and significantly greater than placebo. Collectively, the literature on pharmacological treatment approaches to BED is limited in that very few agents have been studied in multiple, confirmatory trials with adequate follow up, and almost none have been evaluated in large patient samples that are diverse with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. In addition, prior trials have not adequately addressed, through study design, the high placebo response commonly observed in this patient population. Several novel agents are in various phases of testing, and recent animal studies focusing on glutamate-signaling circuits linking the amygdala to the lateral hypothalamus offer new avenues for exploration and potential therapeutic development. Studies of newly FDA-approved medications for long-term obesity treatment and further explorations of dietary supplements and neutraceuticals with appetite- and mood-altering properties may also be worthwhile.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Drugs","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Weight

Our aim was to assess rate and type of errors in DXA examinations/reports, evaluating a consecutive series of DXA images of patients examined elsewhere and later presenting to our institution for a follow-up DXA. METHODS: After ethics committee approval, a radiologist retrospectively reviewed all DXA images provided by patients presenting at our institution for a new DXA. Errors were categorized as patient positioning (PP), data analysis (DA), artefacts and/or demographics. RESULTS: Of 2,476 patients, 1,198 had no previous DXA, while 793 had a previous DXA performed in our institution. The remaining 485 (20 %) patients entered the study (38 men and 447 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 68 ± 9 years). Previous DXA examinations were performed at a total of 37 centres. Of 485 reports, 451 (93 %) had at least one error out of a total of 558 errors distributed as follows: 441 (79 %) were DA, 66 (12 %) PP, 39 (7 %) artefacts and 12 (2 %) demographics. CONCLUSIONS: About 20 % of patients did not undergo DXA at the same institution as previously. More than 90 % of DXA presented at least one error, mainly of DA. International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines are very poorly adopted.

Individuals in the VIP who had developed RA after the dietary survey were identified from medical records at the department of rheumatology at the University Hospital, Umeå (n = 386), and matched to 1,886 controls from the same database. Diet was assessed as food groups, as macronutrients and as scores of dietary patterns, namely the carbohydrate-restricted diet score, the Mediterranean diet score and the healthy diet indicator score. When analysing the dietary patterns, consumption of food groups and different macronutrients, a significant association was found in the highest tertile of carbohydrate-restricted diet among the cases with a subsequent anti-CCP-positive disease 1.40 (1.02-1.92), as well as in the highest tertile of protein consumption among smokers (OR = 1.80, 95 % CI 1.09-2.95). However, after additional adjustment for sodium intake, these associations were no longer statistically significant. No association was observed between alcohol consumption and the risk of RA. To summarize, there were no significant associations between diet, or alcohol consumption, and the risk of development of RA within this cohort.

A sample of 166 transgender adults (112 male-to-female transgender women and 54 female-to-male transgender men) were recruited in community venues and anonymously completed measures assessing these variables. Most participants (64.5 %) were HIV-negative, 25.2 % were HIV-positive, and 10.3 % did not know their HIV status. Overall, 33.7 % of participants reported having met a sexual partner over the internet, which did not differ significantly between transgender women and men. Among these individuals, transgender women reported significantly more lifetime internet sexual partners (median = 3) than transgender men (median = 1). Use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with lower self-esteem but not with depression, anxiety, somatic distress or discrimination experiences. Among transgender women, use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with each of the 11 sexual risk behaviors examined, including having multiple partners, sex under the influence of drugs, number of unprotected anal or vaginal sex acts, and history of commercial sex work. The use of the internet to meet partners was not associated with sexual risk behavior among transgender men (0/11 variables assessed). Although the internet is a common mode of meeting sexual partners among some transgender adults, it may also be a potential venue for prevention interventions targeting transgender individuals at particularly high risk for HIV acquisition.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Archives of sexual behavior","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Health","uri":{"id":"D008603","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk-Taking","uri":{"id":"D012309","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexual Partners","uri":{"id":"D012747","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anonyms and Pseudonyms","uri":{"id":"D000851","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Discrimination (Psychology)","uri":{"id":"D004192","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV","uri":{"id":"D006678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Residence Characteristics","uri":{"id":"D012111","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Work","uri":{"id":"D014937","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internet","uri":{"id":"D020407","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaginitis","uri":{"id":"D014627","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Venus","uri":{"id":"D018536","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transgendered Persons","uri":{"id":"D063106","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428577","title":"Use of the Internet to Meet Sexual Partners, Sexual Risk Behavior, and Mental Health in Transgender Adults.","year":"2014"}

Although CNV is scattered for genes throughout the human genome, several of autoimmunity related genes have CN variation and therefore play an important role in susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. The association of the Fc gamma receptor 3B (FCGR3B) gene copy number in autoimmunity is well characterized in various populations studied. The Fc gamma receptor is a low affinity, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked receptor for IgG molecule predominantly expressed on human neutrophils. The variable gene copy number of FCGR3B is found to be involved in the impaired clearance of immune complexes, which significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes and others. The FCGR3B copy number ranged from 0 to ≥2 copies per diploid genome in other populations, but yet not explored in Indian population. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the variation in the frequency distribution of FCGR3B CNV in Indian population. FCGR3B gene copy number varied significantly when compared to other population of the world. This observation will help us in exploring the potential role of CNV in FCGR3B gene and its association to autoimmune disorders in Indian population.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of immunogenetics","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, Fc","uri":{"id":"D011961","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, IgG","uri":{"id":"D017452","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antigen-Antibody Complex","uri":{"id":"D000936","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Autoimmune Diseases","uri":{"id":"D001327","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic","uri":{"id":"D008180","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome, Human","uri":{"id":"D015894","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptors, IgG","uri":{"id":"D017452","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gene Dosage","uri":{"id":"D018628","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunoglobulin G","uri":{"id":"D007074","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunity","uri":{"id":"D007109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunization","uri":{"id":"D007114","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Autoimmunity","uri":{"id":"D015551","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diploidy","uri":{"id":"D004171","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neutrophils","uri":{"id":"D009504","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25428402","title":"Frequency distribution of autoimmunity associated FCGR3B gene copy number in Indian population.","year":"2014"}

Bone mineral density results add much additional data so densitometry scanning is performed routinely.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Reumatizam","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bone Density","uri":{"id":"D015519","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Calcification, Physiologic","uri":{"id":"D002113","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Musculoskeletal System","uri":{"id":"D009141","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bone Density","uri":{"id":"D015519","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Computers","uri":{"id":"D003201","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Equipment and Supplies","uri":{"id":"D004864","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Minerals","uri":{"id":"D008903","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Radiography","uri":{"id":"D011859","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tomography","uri":{"id":"D014054","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Densitometry","uri":{"id":"D003720","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25427393","title":"[Application of radiological imaging in rheumatoid arthritis].","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease which leads to joint damage, functional im- pairment and reduced quality of life. The disease should be recognized early when there is a \"window of oppor- tunity\" to apply adequate treatment which may prevent structural damage. As clinical presentation of RA is not always typical, great knowledge and clinical experience, including collaboration of rheumatologist, general practi- tioner and patient, are required. The treatment should be started immediately upon the diagnosis, while the choice of modality of treatment depends on the rheumatologist in accordance with the patient. The RA patients with the higher risk of aggressive disease need to be recognized because they require more aggressive treatment from the start. The goal of the treatment is remission or at least low disease activity. Current treatment of RA includes disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) synthetics and biologics, nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, analgesics, and rarely cytostatics. The course of disease is usually fluctuating with the exchange of relapses and remissions. Recognition of the relapsing patient on time enables treatment intensification or modifications in treatment scheme. Special issue in RA represents glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) which should be prevented by usage of calcium and vitamin D supplements and treated by antiresorptive or osteoanabolic agents. Besides the treatment of the primary disease, the care of RA patients should consider comorbidities, side effects of treatment, complications of disease, and psychosocial aspects of chronic disease.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Reumatizam","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic disease that primarily affects joints. Etiology and the pathogenesis of RA are complex, involving many types of cells, among others macrophages, T and B cells, fibro- blasts, chondrocytes and dendritic cells. Despite well documented role of many genes and epigenetic modifications in the development and evolution of the disease, in most RA patients there is no clear predisposing factor present. Environmental factors involved in RA pathogenesis are cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants like silica crystals, disturbances of intestinal, lung, and oral microbiota and some specific bacterial and viral infectious agents and their components. In the initial disease stage there are qualitative and quantitative disturbances ofpeptide citrulination as well as other protein modifications, followed by antigen presenting cell (APC) (macrophages and dendritic cells) and fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS) activation. Some microbes foster this processes by APC and FLS direct and indirect activation. In the second stage APC's elicit specific humoral B cell re- sponse resulting in specific antibodies production and T cell autoreactivity. Inherited and acquired defects in T and B cell responses caused by repeated activation of innate immunity as well as loss of tolerance, elicit chronic autoimmune inflammation, primarily of synovial membranes, and development of cellular panus. Pathologic activation of the osteoclasts and release of the immune system effector molecules and the proteolytic enzymes damage the cartilage, bone and tendons composition and structure. Persistent inflammation through its complex mechanisms results in many systemic and extraarticular RA manifestations of almost all organ systems, resulting in severe complications and comorbidities such as rheumatoid lung, carditis, vasculitis, cahexia, anemia, accelerated atherosclerosis, myocardial and cerebrovascular vascular disease, lymphoma, osteoporosis, depression etc. Accumulated complications and comorbidities finally result in handicap, social dysfunction and premature

Its frequency is increasing steadily Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in a 10-year tracking study of young adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Concurrent cohort study of subjects born between 1974 and 1978. They were evaluated between 2000 and 2002 and between 2010 and 2012 to determine the frequency of MS and its components (high blood glucose, waist circumference [WC], triglycerides, blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol), according to ATP III criteria. Attrition was handled using the reciprocal of the probability of remaining in the study. RESULT: During the first evaluation, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 9.3%, confidence interval (CI): 7.5-11.1), with no gender differences. Ten years later, the prevalence of MS increased significantly to 27.6% (CI: 24.7-29.9) and was more common in women than men (30.4 and 23.8% respectively, p < 0.014). The components of MS also increased from one period to another: hyperglycemia, from 5.2% (CI: 4-7) to 24.4% (CI: 22-27); high triglyceride levels from 17.6% (CI: 15-20) to 35.3% (CI: 32-38); high blood pressure from 14.7 (CI: 13-18) to 30.2% (IC: 28-33) and high WC: 16.9% (CI: 15-19) to 41.5% (CI: 39-45). In both evaluations, there was a greater frequency of high triglycerides and high blood pressure among men, and greater frequency of low HDL and high WC among women. Hyperglycemia only showed differences by gender in the second measurement, and was greater among men. CONCLUSIONS: There was a marked increase in metabolic syndrome and its components in a 10-year interval, which is a warning sign of future cardiovascular risk.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Revista médica de

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"The Fc-glycan profile of IgG1 anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients has recently been reported to be different from non-ACPA IgG1, a phenomenon which likely plays a role in RA pathogenesis. Herein we investigate the Fc-glycosylation pattern of all ACPA-IgG isotypes and simultaneously investigate in detail the IgG protein-chain sequence repertoire. IgG from serum or plasma (S/P, n = 14) and synovial fluid (SF, n = 4) from 18 ACPA-positive RA-patients was enriched using Protein G columns followed by ACPA-purification on cyclic citrullinated peptide-2 (CCP2)-coupled columns. Paired ACPA (anti-CCP2 eluted IgG) and IgG flow through (FT) fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS-proteomics. IgG peptides, isotypes and corresponding Fc-glycopeptides were quantified and interrogated using uni- and multivariate statistics. The Fc-glycans from the IgG4 peptide EEQFNSTYR was validated using protein A column purification. Relative to FT-IgG4, the ACPA-IgG4 Fc-glycan-profile contained lower amounts (p = 0.002) of the agalacto and asialylated core-fucosylated biantennary form (FA2) and higher content (p = 0.001) of sialylated glycans. Novel differences in the Fc-glycan-profile of ACPA-IgG1 compared to FT-IgG1 were observed in the distribution of bisected forms (n = 5, p = 0.0001, decrease) and mono-antennnary forms (n = 3, p = 0.02, increase). Our study also confirmed higher abundance of FA2 (p = 0.002) and lower abundance of afucosylated forms (n = 4, p = 0.001) in ACPA-IgG1 relative to FT-IgG1 as well as lower content of IgG2 (p = 0.0000001) and elevated content of IgG4 (p = 0.004) in ACPA compared to FT. One λ-variable peptide sequence was significantly increased in ACPA (p = 0.0001). In conclusion, the Fc-glycan profile of both ACPA-IgG1 and ACPA-IgG4 are distinct. Given that IgG1 and IgG4 have different Fc-receptor and complement binding affinities, this phenomenon likely affects ACPA effector- and immune-regulatory functions in an IgG isotype-specific manner. These findings further highlight the importance of antibody characterization in relation to functional in vivo and in vitro studies.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"PloS one","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides, Cyclic","uri":{"id":"D010456","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Synovial Fluid","uri":{"id":"D013582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antibodies","uri":{"id":"D000906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Immunoglobulin G","uri":{"id":"D007074","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Peptides","uri":{"id":"D010455","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Periodicity","uri":{"id":"D010507","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polysaccharides","uri":{"id":"D011134","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Citrulline","uri":{"id":"D002956","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Staphylococcal Protein A","uri":{"id":"D013205","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25426976","title":"IgG antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides exhibit profiles specific in terms of IgG subclasses, fc-glycans and a fab-Peptide sequence.","year":"2014"}

They employ multi-faceted approaches to maintain bone marrow niche homeostasis and promote wound healing during injury. Biomedical research has long sought to exploit their pleiotropic properties as a basis for cell therapy for a variety of diseases and to facilitate hematopoietic stem cell establishment and stromal reconstruction in bone marrow transplantation. Early results demonstrated their usage as safe, and there was little host response to these cells. The discovery of their immunosuppressive functions ushered in a new interest in MSCs as a promising therapeutic tool to suppress inflammation and down-regulate pathogenic immune responses in graft-versus-host and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. MSCs produce a large number of soluble and membrane-bound factors, some of which inhibit immune responses. However, the full range of MSC-mediated immune-modulation remains incompletely understood, as emerging reports also reveal that MSCs can adopt an immunogenic phenotype, stimulate immune cells, and yield seemingly contradictory results in experimental animal models of inflammatory disease. The present review describes the large body of literature that has been accumulated on the fascinating biology of MSCs and their complex effects on immune responses.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"World journal of stem

METHODS: Men (aged ≥20 years) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen levels: ≥5 ng/ml), who had received 1 or 2 cytotoxic chemotherapies (with ≥1 regimen being docetaxel) for prostate cancer, were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm study. Primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients achieving a ≥50% prostate-specific antigen decline from baseline (prostate-specific antigen response rate) after 12-week treatment. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also assessed. RESULTS: Confirmed prostate-specific antigen response rate by Week 12 was 28.3% (90% confidence interval: 17.6%; 41.1%) or 13 out of 46 (full analysis set) treated patients. However, total prostate-specific antigen response rate including confirmed and unconfirmed responses was 34.8% (90% confidence interval: 23.2%; 47.9%). Secondary efficacy endpoints and outcomes were: improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score by ≥1 unit: 7/16 patients (43.8%); objective radiographic response: complete response, partial response and stable disease in 0, 1/22 (4.5%) and 9/22 (40.9%) patients, respectively; pain palliation response: 9/16 (56.3%) patients. The most common adverse events (>20% patients) were upper respiratory tract infection (13/47, 27.7% patients) and hepatic function abnormal (10/47, 21.3% patients, Grade 3: 8.5%). All mineralocorticoid-related toxicities were Grade 1/2. CONCLUSIONS: Abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone showed favorable efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Japanese patients who had received chemotherapy.

Argentine Consortium for Early Arthritis (CONAART) is the first early arthritis cohort in Argentina. Patients with one or more swollen joints and less than 2 years of symptoms duration were followed up prospectively in 13 departments of rheumatology. Social, demographic, familiar, clinical, and laboratory data were recollected. At first year and every year, X-rays of hands and feet were performed and working status and pharmaco-economic data were recollected. Work status (employed, unemployed, retired) and type of work were assessed by direct interview using a predesigned questionnaire. Eight hundred forty-eight patients were included, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) = 483 (57 %)and undifferentiated arthritis (UA) = 365 (43 %), 694 (81.8 %) were women, median age was 46 years (interquartile range (IQR) 35-55.7) and median symptoms duration 7 months (IQR 3-12). Patients with RA had significantly higher disease activity, worse functional capacity and quality of life, and more severe radiological damage compared to UA patients. However work disability (unemployed patient) was comparable between groups (RA = 21 % versus UA = 18.6 % p = NS). In both groups, unemployed patients had higher disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28), worse Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) values, and less years of formal education (p value <0.005 in all comparisons). Radiological damage was greater in unemployed patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, disease activity was the main variable associated with unemployment in both groups. Joint involvement was the main cause of work disability in this cohort of patients with early arthritis, independently of the final diagnosis. KEY MESSAGES: 1.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is implicated in a variety of clinically important diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific small molecule CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which has activity at CXCR3 and also the receptors CCR2 and CCR5. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Molecular modeling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ) which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modeling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation. KEY RESULTS: Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and Tyr-271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity but perturbed the activity of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutation of Phe-131(3.32) , Ile-279(6.59) and Tyr-308(7.43) was well tolerated and was found to be critical for the activity of VUF 10085 but dispensable for the activity of TAK-779.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Aim: The aims of this study were to investigate how common it is to change primary diagnosis between different diagnostic chapters during a sick-leave spell, and to explore patterns of diagnostic changes. Methods: The unit for analysis was episode of sickness benefit, that is, sick leave >14 days, which commenced between 2010 and 2012 in Sweden. For each case, the primary diagnosis was retrieved from the first and last/latest medical sickness certificate, respectively. The number of days of sickness benefit was linked to the cases. Any change of primary diagnosis was analysed by diagnostic chapter according to the ICD-10, and this was done separately for women and men. Results: In total, 803,041 cases of sickness benefit (63% women) were included in the study. During a sick-leave spell, 7.1% of female cases and 6.6% of male cases changed their primary diagnosis to a diagnosis from another diagnostic chapter. The change of primary diagnosis increased with the number of days with sickness benefit. For female cases, this increase was from 2.0% for cases that lasted 15-30 days to 20.2% for cases that lasted >365 days. For male cases, the corresponding increase was from 1.8% to 21.2%. A change of primary diagnosis was least common among those initially sick-listed for mental disorders and musculoskeletal disorders. The patterns of diagnostic changes were rather similar for women and men. CONCLUSIONS: A change of diagnosis during a sick-leave spell needs to be taken into consideration by the sickness insurance system and in the actions taken by its administration. Registry-based studies of sickness insurance need to consider diagnostic changes in both the study design and the interpretation of results.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Scandinavian journal of public health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sick Leave","uri":{"id":"D018582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mental Disorders","uri":{"id":"D001523","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sick Leave","uri":{"id":"D018582","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sweden","uri":{"id":"D013548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Theory of Mind","uri":{"id":"D056345","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Certification","uri":{"id":"D002568","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance","uri":{"id":"D007341","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insurance Carriers","uri":{"id":"D007343","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"International Classification of Diseases","uri":{"id":"D038801","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425228","title":"How common is change of primary diagnosis during an episode of sickness benefit?

This review identified and synthesized published literature on the association between early first sexual intercourse and later sexual/reproductive outcomes. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Current Contents. In all, 65 citations met the selection criteria (industrialized, population-based studies). By far the most common sexual behavior to have been investigated has been sexual partners. Studies consistently reported early first intercourse to be associated with more recent, lifetime, and concurrent sexual partners. Early initiators were also more likely to participate in a wider range of sexual practices and report increased sexual satisfaction (among men). Furthermore, early first intercourse, in some studies, was shown to increase the risk of teen pregnancies, teen births, and having an abortion, while findings on STIs and contraceptive use have been mixed. These findings, however, must be interpreted with caution due to methodological problems and limitations present in the research, including a lack of consensus on what constitutes early sexual intercourse and inconsistencies and problems with analyses.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Archives of sexual behavior","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coitus","uri":{"id":"D003075","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexual Behavior","uri":{"id":"D012725","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Selection","uri":{"id":"D018579","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy in Adolescence","uri":{"id":"D011253","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexual Partners","uri":{"id":"D012747","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Reproductive Health","uri":{"id":"D060728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adolescent","uri":{"id":"D000293","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Contraceptive Agents","uri":{"id":"D003270","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Industry","uri":{"id":"D007221","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pregnancy","uri":{"id":"D011247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consensus","uri":{"id":"D032921","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Personal Satisfaction","uri":{"id":"D010549","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425161","title":"Associations Between Early First Sexual Intercourse and Later Sexual and Reproductive Outcomes: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Data.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent entity in elderly men and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) still represents the gold standard of surgical treatment despite its considerable perioperative morbidity. Recently, prostatic artery embolization (PAE) was described as a novel effective and less invasive treatment alternative. Despite promising first results, PAE still has to be considered experimental due to a lack of good quality studies. Prospective randomized controlled trials comparing PAE with TUR-P are highly warranted.Methods/design: This is a single-centre, prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment effects and adverse events of PAE and TURP in a tertiary referral centre. One hundred patients who are electable for both treatment options are randomized to either PAE or TURP. Changes of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) after 3 months are defined as primary endpoint. Changes in bladder diaries, laboratory analyses, urodynamic investigations and standardised questionnaires are assessed as secondary outcome measures. In addition contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis before and after the interventions will provide crucial information regarding morphological changes and vascularisation of the prostate. Adverse events will be assessed on every follow-up visit in both treatment arms according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events and the Clavien classification. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to assess whether PAE represents a valid treatment alternative to TURP in patients suffering from BPH in terms of efficacy and safety.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02054013.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC urology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transurethral Resection of Prostate","uri":{"id":"D020728","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","uri":{"id":"D017063","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatic Hyperplasia","uri":{"id":"D011470","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"National Cancer Institute (U.S.)","uri":{"id":"D054547","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Academies and Institutes","uri":{"id":"D000047","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Aged","uri":{"id":"D000368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arteries","uri":{"id":"D001158","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyperplasia","uri":{"id":"D006965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Laboratories","uri":{"id":"D007753","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Morbidity","uri":{"id":"D009017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostate","uri":{"id":"D011467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatitis","uri":{"id":"D011472","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Questionnaires","uri":{"id":"D011795","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Stress, Psychological","uri":{"id":"D013315","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatism","uri":{"id":"D053448","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pelvis","uri":{"id":"D010388","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urodynamics","uri":{"id":"D014563","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Transurethral Resection of Prostate","uri":{"id":"D020728","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25425136","title":"Prostatic artery embolization versus conventional TUR-P in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: protocol for a prospective randomized non-inferiority trial.","year":"2014"}

The neurobiological basis of the female dominance has been partly established. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on the headache manifestations in migraine patients. METHODS: The study group consisted of 2082 adult patients from five different hospitals' tertiary care-based headache clinics. The relationship between headache characteristics and gender was evaluated in migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA). The duration, severity, frequency of headache and associated symptoms were evaluated in both genders and age-dependent variations and analyzed in two subgroups. RESULTS: Women with migraine were prone to significantly longer duration and intensity of headache attacks. Nausea, phonophobia and photophobia were more prevalent in women. Median headache duration was also longer in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.013) and MwoA (p < 0.001). Median headache intensity was higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.010) and MwoA (p = 0.009). The frequency of nausea was significantly higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.049). Throbbing headache quality and associated features (nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) were significantly more frequent in women than in men in MwoA. The gender impact varied across age groups and significant changes were seen in female migraineurs after age 30. No age-dependent variation was observed in male migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Gender has an influence on the characteristics of the headache as well as on the associated symptoms in migraine patients, and this impact varies across the age groups, particularly in women.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Observer Variation","uri":{"id":"D015588","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Symptom Assessment","uri":{"id":"D063189","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Age Groups","uri":{"id":"D009273","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache","uri":{"id":"D006261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Migraine Disorders","uri":{"id":"D008881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Migraine with Aura","uri":{"id":"D020325","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Migraine without Aura","uri":{"id":"D020326","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache Disorders","uri":{"id":"D020773","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache Disorders, Primary","uri":{"id":"D051270","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tertiary Care Centers","uri":{"id":"D062606","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Adult","uri":{"id":"D000328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Female","uri":{"id":"D005260","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Headache","uri":{"id":"D006261","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Migraine Disorders","uri":{"id":"D008881","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hyperacusis","uri":{"id":"D012001","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Photophobia","uri":{"id":"D020795","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424708","title":"Gender influences headache characteristics with increasing age in migraine patients.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a peptidylarginine residue to form a citrulline residue and ammonia during posttranslational modification. This process plays a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gene regulation. F-amidine belongs to a series of haloacetamidine compounds that are the most potent PAD4 inhibitors described to date. F-amidine acts as a mechanism-based inhibitor of PAD4, inactivating PAD4 by the covalent modification of the active site Cys645. In this manuscript, the fundamental mechanism of PAD4 inhibition by F-amidine is investigated using a QM/MM approach. Our simulations show that in the PAD4-F-amidine reactant complex, the active site Cys645 exists as a thiolate and His471 is protonated. This is consistent with the reverse protonation mechanism wherein the active site nucleophile, Cys645, in PAD4 exists as a thiolate in the active form of the enzyme. Inhibition of PAD4 by F-amidine is initiated by the nucleophilic addition of Sγ to the Cζ of F-amidine, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. His471 serves as a proton donor, helping F to leave the fluoroacetamidine moiety of F-amidine; meanwhile, Sγ forms a three-membered ring with Cζ and Cη of F-amidine. Subsequently, the three-membered sulfonium ring collapses and rearranges to the final thioether product. His471 acts as a proton donor in the transition state and facilitates the inhibition reaction of PAD4.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of molecular graphics & modelling","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes, Regulator","uri":{"id":"D005809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protein Processing, Post-Translational","uri":{"id":"D011499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Catalytic Domain","uri":{"id":"D020134","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Models, Theoretical","uri":{"id":"D008962","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Enzymes","uri":{"id":"D004798","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrolysis","uri":{"id":"D006868","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Protons","uri":{"id":"D011522","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissue Donors","uri":{"id":"D014019","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arginine","uri":{"id":"D001120","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Citrulline","uri":{"id":"D002956","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sulfides","uri":{"id":"D013440","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424656","title":"Theoretical study of the mechanism of protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibition by F-amidine.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: In rodent models of inflammatory arthritis, bone erosion has been non-invasively assessed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). However, non-invasive assessments of paw swelling (oedema) are still based on clinical grading by visual evaluation, or measurements by callipers, not always reliable for the tiny mouse paws. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a novel straightforward 3D micro-CT analysis protocol capable of quantifying not only joint bone erosion, but also soft tissue swelling, from the same scans, in a rodent inflammatory arthritis model. Balb/c mice were divided into two groups: Collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA), and CAIA treated with Prednisolone, the latter reflecting an established treatment in human rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical paw scores were recorded. On day 10, front paws were assessed by micro-CT and histology. Micro-CT measurements included paw volume (bone and soft tissue together) and bone volume at the radiocarpal joint, and bone volume from the radiocarpal to the metacarpophalangeal joint. Micro-CT analysis revealed significantly lower paw volume (-36%, p<0.01) and higher bone volume (+17%, p<0.05) in Prednisolone-treated CAIA mice compared to untreated CAIA mice. Paw volume and bone volume assessed by micro-CT correlated significantly with clinical and histological scores (|r|>0.5, p<0.01). Untreated CAIA mice showed significantly higher clinical scores, higher inflammation levels histologically, cartilage and bone degradation, and pannus formation, compared to treated mice (p<0.01). The presented novel micro-CT analysis protocol enables 3D-quantification of paw swelling at the micro-meter level, along with the typically-assessed bone erosion, using the same images/scans, without altering the scanning procedure or using contrast agents.

The AA genotype was significantly associated with high/severe RA activity (P < 0.001), while the GG genotype (wild type IRS-1) had protective effects. CONCLUSION: The Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism is associated with increased risk and disease activity/severity of RA, and therefore may be a potential prognostic factor for RA. This study adds novel insights into the pathogenesis of RA.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of rheumatic diseases","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins","uri":{"id":"D055504","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Receptor, Insulin","uri":{"id":"D011972","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Body Mass Index","uri":{"id":"D015992","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins","uri":{"id":"D055504","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insulin","uri":{"id":"D007328","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internship and Residency","uri":{"id":"D007396","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comorbidity","uri":{"id":"D015897","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Insulins","uri":{"id":"D061385","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424426","title":"Arg(972) insulin receptor substrate-1 polymorphism and risk and severity of rheumatoid arthritis.","year":"2014"}

Relaxation techniques (TR) and biofeedback (BFB) are widely used in psychiatric and psychological practice for the treatment for anxiety and stress-related disorders. Methods. An examination of studies focusing on the correlates of psychophysiology of relaxation and biofeedback has been done, in addiction to controlled therapeutic studies that describes clinical aspects, efficacy and limits. Results. There are different TR and BFB procedures, but they have the same goal and same physiological modifications, resulting in stress and anxiety reduction. There is a proven action to musculoskeletal, neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system, showing similar results. Very few data on immune changes are available. Meta-Analysis show superior efficacy to no treatment or placebo in anxiety disorders, tension headache, bruxism, temporomandibular pain syndrome, rehabilitation and prevention of ischemic heart disease. Moderate efficacy is shown for chronic low back pain, cancer-related pain, rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal disorders; data for essential hypertension are controversial. Variability of techniques, procedures, sampling problems, non-systematic make definitive conclusions difficult. TR and BFB are often used in combination with cognitive-behavioral and educational techniques. The association of the active relaxation technique facilitates generalization and self-control during stress situation and outside the training session. Conclusions. TR and BFB are effective for anxiety and somatic stress-related disorders, associated with coping and quality of life improvement and affordable costs; they are minimally invasive but needing an active participation in the treatment process. Some limits are responders' prediction, continuity of practice and limited effectiveness for depression disorders. Finally, it is shown that they are real psychosomatic therapies that are able to produce somatic peripheral changes (neuroendocrine, neurovegetative and muscular systems) generated by the mind and secondary to the involvement of central neurotransmitter circuits.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Rivista di

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Experimental vaccination to induce antibodies (Abs) capable of cytokine antagonism shows promise as a novel immunotherapy for chronic inflammatory disease. We prepared a hybrid antigen consisting of residues 141-235 of rat TNF-α fused to the C-terminus of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), chemically modified to incorporate aldehyde residues, for development of an auto-vaccine eliciting anti-rTNF-α Abs. In rat immunization the soluble aldehyde-modified fusion protein did not generate observable Ab responses. By contrast, vaccination with the aldehyde-modified fusion protein adsorbed on alum induced anti-TNF-α autoAbs with high titer and neutralizing activity. Induction of adjuvant arthritis in rats pre-immunized with unmodified fusion protein or a control protein in alum resulted in severe inflammation and joint damage, whereas the disease induced in rats immunized with the aldehyde-bearing fusion protein in alum was markedly attenuated. Similar results were obtained in a collagen-induced rat arthritis model. Anti-collagen II IgG Ab titers did not deviate significantly in groups pre-immunized with modified fusion protein and control protein, suggesting that anti-TNF vaccination did not skew the immune response related to disease induction. This study demonstrates synergy between particulate alum and protein bound carbonyl residues for enhancement of protein immunogenicity. The antigen-specific co-adjuvant system could prove advantageous for breaking tolerance in emerging auto-vaccination therapies targeting inflammatory cytokines as well as for enhancing a broader category of subunit vaccines. Aldehyde adduction introduces a minimal modification which, together with the established use of alum as a safe adjuvant for human use, could be favorable for further vaccine development.

A 75-fold increase in TCGT development has been reported for monozygotic (MZ) twins. Therefore, the occurrence of simultaneous tumors in MZ twins emphasizes the importance of genetic factors that influence the risk of developing these tumors. Genomic screening was performed for one family containing MZ twins with testicular germ cell tumors, in order to define alterations associated with risk of tumor development.MethodsCopy number alterations were evaluated using array-CGH (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) in one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma (EC) from MZ twins. In addition, genomic alterations from the tumors and peripheral blood cells of the twins were compared to the parental genomes via their peripheral blood cells.ResultsEmbryonal carcinoma (Twin-1 t) presented a lower frequency of genomic alterations compared to the seminoma (Twin-2 t). One minimal common region of loss was observed in 9p13.1-p12 in the comparison between DNA from blood samples for Twin-1 and Twin-2. In this region is mapped the CNTNAP3 gene which was confirmed as involved in losses by qPCR. Comparative analysis of novel CNVs between the Twin-1 t and Twin-2 t showed five minimal common regions involving gain at chromosomes 12 (12p12.3-p11.1 and 12p13.33-p12.3), while losses were observed at 10p15.3-p15.2, 13q21.1-q21.2 and 15q11.1-q11.2. In addition, one exclusive rare copy number alteration was detected in Twin-1 t and Twin-2 t, and 19 novel alterations were identified in the Twin-2 t.ConclusionDistinct genomic profiles for MZ twins with phenotypically different TGCT were described. Of particular interest, 12p gains were detected exclusively in tumor samples. In peripheral blood samples, loss of 9p13.1-p12 was the unique novel CNV shared by the twins, confirming the involvement of CNTNAP3 gene in TGCTs development. Although similar CNV profiles were shared by both the peripheral blood and tumor samples of the twins, tumor-specific CNV loci were identified for seminoma and non-seminomatous tumors. These findings suggest the presence of de novo germline structural alterations and TGCT predisposition.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Orphanet journal of rare diseases","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Twins, Monozygotic","uri":{"id":"D014430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Twinning, Monozygotic","uri":{"id":"D038522","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Blood Cells","uri":{"id":"D001773","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Germ Cells","uri":{"id":"D005854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal","uri":{"id":"D009373","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Twins, Monozygotic","uri":{"id":"D014430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Embryonal","uri":{"id":"D018236","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Twinning, Monozygotic","uri":{"id":"D038522","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chromosomes","uri":{"id":"D002875","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"DNA","uri":{"id":"D004247","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genes","uri":{"id":"D005796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D009369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parents","uri":{"id":"D010290","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Phenotype","uri":{"id":"D010641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Technology","uri":{"id":"D013672","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genome","uri":{"id":"D016678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genomics","uri":{"id":"D023281","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seminoma","uri":{"id":"D018239","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25424124","title":"Genomic screening of testicular germ cell tumors from monozygotic twins.","year":"2014"}

Modern treatment of these diseases is focused on reducing the inflammatory process responsible for the development of the disease. In recent years, the treatment of psoriasis is developing at a dynamic rate. Such therapeutic advances are contributed to the possibility of patient therapy through the use of some registered biologic agents, such as TNF-α inhibitors (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab), and an inhibitor of the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 (ustekinumab). In addition to the already registered medications for the indications mentioned above, there is a large group of preparations that are currently undergoing clinical trials in Europe, Canada and the U.S., which provides hopes of therapy efficacy and safety. The study aims to provide updated information on the subject of apremilast- a new therapeutic agent, which is currently in the late stage of clinical trials in the indication of psoriasis vulgaris

We describe a case series of analytically confirmed intoxications involving 3-MMC presented to emergency departments in Sweden and included in the STRIDA project. Study design. Observational case series of consecutive patients with self-reported or suspected use of NPS presenting to hospitals in Sweden between August 2012 and March 2014. Methods. NPS analysis was performed by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS method that is updated with new substances as they appear. Data on clinical features were collected during Poisons Information Centre consultations and retrieved from medical records. Results. 3-MMC was detected in 50 (6.4%) of the 786 cases included in the STRIDA project during the 20-month study period, with the peak occurring in August 2013. The age range of patients testing positive for 3-MMC was 17-49 years (median 24) and 76% of them were men. The 3-MMC concentration in serum ranged between 0.002 and 1.49 μg/mL (median, 0.091) and between 0.007 and 290 μg/mL (median, 3.05) in urine. Co-exposure to other NPS and/or traditional drugs was very common, and 3-MMC mono-intoxication was found in only 4 (8%) cases. The most frequent clinical features were tachycardia (48% of cases) and agitation (42%). Other features included a reduced level of consciousness (32%), dilated pupils (24%), hallucinations (20%), diaphoresis (12%), seizures (8%), and hyperthermia (6%). Most patients (60%) needed hospital care for only 1 day but in 8% for 3 days or longer. Conclusion. The majority of patients with analytically confirmed 3-MMC exposure had sympathomimetic features similar to those associated with mephedrone intoxication. However, the high incidence of co-exposure to other drugs makes the clinical interpretation difficult. Nevertheless, 3-MMC was associated with a high admittance rate to intensive care (30%), and detected in two cases with a fatal outcome, suggesting that 3-MMC is a harmful drug.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emergency Service, Hospital","uri":{"id":"D004636","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medical Records","uri":{"id":"D008499","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Intensive Care","uri":{"id":"D017055","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fatal Outcome","uri":{"id":"D017809","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dihydroergotamine","uri":{"id":"D004087","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dilatation","uri":{"id":"D004106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Emergencies","uri":{"id":"D004630","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fever","uri":{"id":"D005334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Seizures","uri":{"id":"D012640","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spectrum Analysis","uri":{"id":"D013057","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sweden","uri":{"id":"D013548","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tachycardia","uri":{"id":"D013610","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urination","uri":{"id":"D014554","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Urine","uri":{"id":"D014556","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Serum","uri":{"id":"D044967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Consciousness","uri":{"id":"D003243","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hallucinations","uri":{"id":"D006212","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Poisons","uri":{"id":"D011042","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sympathomimetics","uri":{"id":"D013566","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422862","title":"Characteristics of analytically confirmed 3-MMC-related intoxications from the Swedish STRIDA project.","year":"2014"}

Research on women who are aware of a high-risk male partner may inform HIV prevention. We analyzed transcripts from semi-structured interviews with 20 Black women who reported sex with at least one man who had sex with men and women (MSMW) in the prior 5 years. We applied Choice and Sexual Network theories to the interpretation. The majority described their partnerships as committed and involving emotional or instrumental support. Substance abuse was a common component of the relationships and very few involved consistent condom use. Although nearly all respondents described it as alarming to learn of their partners' involvement with other men and several ended the relationships, many continued the relationships without protective changes in their sex behavior. These narratives indicate that although many leave, many other women remain in relationships after learning of a male partners' high-risk activity. Substance abuse, financial instability, and a desire to remain in intimate partnerships may discourage preventive actions in these women.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Sexuality & culture","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexual Behavior","uri":{"id":"D012725","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV Infections","uri":{"id":"D015658","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Substance-Related Disorders","uri":{"id":"D019966","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Americans","uri":{"id":"D001741","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Awareness","uri":{"id":"D001364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"HIV","uri":{"id":"D006678","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Learning","uri":{"id":"D007858","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Sexuality","uri":{"id":"D019529","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"African Continental Ancestry Group","uri":{"id":"D044383","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tobacco Use Cessation Products","uri":{"id":"D061485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bisexuality","uri":{"id":"D001727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Condoms","uri":{"id":"D017280","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422580","title":"Partnerships between Black Women and Behaviorally Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV Risk and Prevention.","year":"2014"}

The increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels through the activation of store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated channels (CRACs) is involved in mediating a disparate array of cellular responses by these immune cells. This study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of the regulation of Ca(2+) entry in the treatment of RA. To moderately suppress Ca(2+) entry via CRACs, we gene silenced CRACM3, which was induced by systemic application of specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) using a lentiviral-delivery system, in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The inflammatory responses were determined by measuring the levels of a panel of cytokines and chemokines in the joints and serum. Ag-specific responses were evaluated by determining the cytokine profile of T cells stimulated with autoantigen. We also analyzed the ability of specific CRACM3-shRNA to regulate mature osteoclast function in CIA mice. The therapeutic effect of lentiviral-delivered CRACM3-shRNA was associated with gene silencing of CRACM3, along with the successful biodistribution of the virus. Extracellular Ca(2+) influx in the splenocytes, thymocytes, and knee joint synovial cells was moderately suppressed. Inflammatory responses and autoimmune responses were reduced by CRACM3 gene silencing. A decrease in mature osteoclast activity also was observed in CRACM3-shRNA-treated CIA mice. These results indicate that regulation of Ca(2+) entry through lentivirus-mediated CRACM3 gene silencing is beneficial in the treatment of RA.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with pancreatic cancer, who were admitted to Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Oncology, were enrolled in the study Results: The mean age was 59±20. Forty-nine (63.6%) were men and 28 women (36.4%) . Sixty-eight (88.3%) patients had adenocarcinoma and 9 (11.7%) had a malignant epithelial tumor. Thirty-six (46.7%) had liver metastasis at diagnosis. Twenty-six (33.8%) patients were alive, 20 (26%) were dead and in 31 (40.2%) the status was unknown. Only 14 (18.1%) patients had DVT. In 42 (54.5%) patients MPV values were normal, in 28 (36.4%) patients they were above normal, and in 7 (9.1%) patients they were below normal. There was no statistically significant difference between gender, tumour localization, chemotherapy and survival rates (p:0.56, p:0.11, p:0.21). There was no significant difference between DVT, gender, localisation, histological subtype, the presence of metastasis, stage and if the patient had been treated with chemotherapy (p:0.5, p:0.6, p:0.2, p:0.32, p:0.1, p:0.84). There was also no significant difference between MPV and DVT (p:0.57) but there was a significant difference between liver metastasis and DVT (p:0.02). Age, stage, the presence of metastasis and DVT were prognostic in pancreatic cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: The educational needs assessment tool was developed to enable patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis to assess their education needs prior to a consultation with a health professional. The educational needs assessment tool has been translated into nine languages and measurement properties have been established, however, its usability in clinical practice has not been studied. DESIGN: A qualitative study embedded into a multicentre RCT in which patients had been randomised into either educational needs assessment tool-focused education (Experimental Group) or usual care (control group). METHODS: Both groups were seen by a clinical nurse specialist. Sixteen patients and four clinical nurse specialists were recruited from the Rheumatology Outpatient Departments of three Acute Hospitals within the U K. Data were collected by interviews with patients and clinical nurse specialist. Analysis followed the Framework approach. RESULTS: Patients and clinical nurse specialist found completion of the educational needs assessment tool straightforward, comprehensive and easy to use. Completing the educational needs assessment tool helped patients to focus on what they needed to know from the clinical nurse specialist. Patients in both the control group and the experimental group felt supported and reassured by their clinical nurse specialist and perceived that they received a good and adequate education provision. CONCLUSION: This study provides useful insights into the ability of the educational needs assessment tool to assess the educational needs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in routine clinical practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The educational needs assessment tool would be useful as a structured guide for nurses when assessing and meeting individual patient educational needs. This has the potential to improve patient-centred care, involve patients more actively in their care and enhance the long-term effects of patient education provision.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of clinical nursing","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Care","uri":{"id":"D005791","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Educational Measurement","uri":{"id":"D004521","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Assessment","uri":{"id":"D009730","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Education as Topic","uri":{"id":"D010353","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Self-Help Groups","uri":{"id":"D012657","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Needs Assessment","uri":{"id":"D020380","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Time","uri":{"id":"D013995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Control Groups","uri":{"id":"D035061","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurse Clinicians","uri":{"id":"D009720","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing Staff","uri":{"id":"D009740","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patient Education as Topic","uri":{"id":"D010353","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Needs Assessment","uri":{"id":"D020380","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Education","uri":{"id":"D004493","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Language","uri":{"id":"D007802","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nurses","uri":{"id":"D009726","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nursing","uri":{"id":"D009729","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Outpatients","uri":{"id":"D010045","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rheumatology","uri":{"id":"D012219","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25422168","title":"Patients and nursing staff views of using the education needs assessment tool in rheumatology clinics: a qualitative study.","year":"2014"}

Although the total numbers of men and women living with heart failure are similar, female patients are underrepresented in clinical studies, with current knowledge predominantly based on data from male patients. This has led to an underappreciation of the sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and pathophysiology-based management of heart failure. Similar disparities have been found in management of acute arrhythmias, especially atrial arrhythmias that lead to an increased risk of stroke in women. Additionally, peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy represent a diagnostic and treatment dilemma. This article is the result of a breakout session in the cardiovascular and resuscitation work group of the 2014 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference \"Gender-Specific Research in Emergency Medicine: Investigate, Understand, and Translate How Gender Affects Patient Outcomes.\" A nominal group technique was used to identify and prioritize themes and research questions using electronic mail, monthly conference calls, in-person meetings, and Web-based surveys between June 2013 and May 2014. Consensus was achieved through three rounds of nomination followed by the meeting on May 13, 2014, and resulted in seven priority themes that are essential to the common complex clinical syndrome of heart failure for both men and women and include the areas of pathophysiology; presentation and symptomatology; and diagnostic strategies using biomarkers, treatment, and mortality, with special consideration to arrhythmia management and pregnancy.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency

Sleep quality impairment has been reported in both diseases. The goal of this study was to compare sleep quality and depression between women with MS and migraine. Seventy women with migraine and 75 women with MS were enrolled in this study. Participants were asked to fill-out valid and reliable Persian versions of Pittsburg Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Mean age and duration of disease for MS group was 31.1 ± 7.6, 4.8 ± 5 and for second group 31.4 ± 5.6, 5.2 ± 4 years, respectively. Mean BDI score and number of patients with poor sleep (PSQI ≥5) were significantly higher in patients with migraine. There was significant positive correlation between PSQI and BDI scores in all participants (r=0.32, P<0.001), while correlation coefficient was 0.39, P=0.001 in patients with migraine and 0.35, P=0.002 in MS cases. Multiple linear regression analysis between the PSQI as a dependent variable and age, BDI and education level as independent variables showed that BDI is the independent predictors of PSQI in both groups.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coexisting chronic conditions (multimorbidity) is rising. Disease labels, however, give little information about impact on subjective health and personal illness experience. We aim to examine the strength of association of single and multimorbid physical chronic diseases with self-rated health in a middle-aged and older population in England, and to determine whether any association is mediated by depression and other psychosocial factors. METHODS: 25 268 individuals aged 39 to 79 years recruited from general practice registers in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC-Norfolk) study, completed a survey including self-rated health, psychosocial function and presence of common physical chronic conditions (cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, asthma/bronchitis and arthritis). Logistic regression models determined odds of \"moderate/poor\" compared to \"good/excellent\" health by condition and number of conditions adjusting for psychosocial measures. RESULTS: One-third (8252) reported one, around 7.5% (1899) two, and around 1% (194) three or more conditions. Odds of \"moderate/poor\" self-rated health worsened with increasing number of conditions (one (OR = 1.3(1.2-1.4)) versus three or more (OR = 3.4(2.3-5.1)), and were highest where there was comorbidity with stroke (OR = 8.7(4.6-16.7)) or heart attack (OR = 8.5(5.3-13.6)). Psychosocial measures did not explain the association between chronic diseases and multimorbidity with self-rated health.The relationship of multimorbidity with self-rated health was particularly strong in men compared to women (three or more conditions: men (OR = 5.2(3.0-8.9)), women OR = 2.1(1.1-3.9)). CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health provides a simple, integrative patient-centred assessment for evaluation of illness in the context of multiple chronic disease diagnoses. Those registering in general practice in particular men with three or more diseases or those with cardiovascular comorbidities and with poorer self-rated health may warrant further assessment and intervention to improve their physical and subjective health.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"BMC family practice","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D006338","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Chronic Disease","uri":{"id":"D002908","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Sectional Studies","uri":{"id":"D003430","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychology","uri":{"id":"D011584","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Practice","uri":{"id":"D058006","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asthma","uri":{"id":"D001249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Comorbidity","uri":{"id":"D015897","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bronchitis","uri":{"id":"D001991","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"England","uri":{"id":"D004739","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25421440","title":"Association of self-rated health with multimorbidity, chronic disease and psychosocial factors in a large middle-aged and older cohort from general practice: a cross-sectional study.","year":"2014"}

It is still debated whether closed or open reduction gives optimal results. This study aimed to describe and assess a closed reduction and mini-external fixator fixation technique for the treatment of Bennett's fracture dislocation and to compare this technique versus open reduction and internal fixation. METHODS: From October 2002 to December 2012, 56 patients with Bennett's fracture dislocation were treated by closed reduction and mini-external fixator fixation and 32 patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation in Jishuitan Hospital. Patients with an articular step-off of more than 1 mm were excluded. All patients were assessed at a mean follow-up of 7 years (range 2-10 years) and the two groups were compared with pain levels, active range of trapeziometacarpal motion, grip strength and pinch strength, arthritic changes, and adduction deformity. RESULTS: Based on primary closed reduction maintained , the rate of anatomic reduction is 63.6%. Radiographic fracture union was achieved in all patients at a mean time of 5 weeks. At the final follow-up, there was no difference between the two groups in mean union time and pain levels (P = 0.2). There was also no difference between the two groups regarding the active range of trapeziometacarpal motion (P = 0.3), grip stength (P = 0.6), pinch strength (P = 0.2), arthritic change and loss of reduction (P = 0.2). There was a significant correlation between adduction deformity and the development of arthritis (P = 0.02).

This study evaluated more than 10-year clinical outcomes and survivorship of patellar resurfacing or nonresurfacing in total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: From January 1993 to December 2002, 265 patients accepted total knee arthroplasty in Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Among them, 226 patients (246 knees) were successfully followed up, with 176 knees for patellar resurfacing and 70 knees for nonresurfacing. The survivorship of total knee arthroplasty between two groups and the hospital for special surgery knee score (HSS), patellar score, patellar related complication and radiological results were studied at the latest follow-up. RESULTS: The HSS knee score increased from 55.9±12.2 preoperatively to 92.0±10.9 postoperatively for patellar resurfacing group and from 56.6±9.9 to 94.2±11.4 for nonresurfacing group after average 11.4-year follow-up. Patellar score increased from 13.93±2.42 preoperatively to 28.33±2.20 for resurfacing group and from 13.55±2.73 to 27.8±2.37 for nonresurfacing group. There was no statistically significant difference for both HSS score, patellar score between the two groups with higher rate of anterior knee pain for nonresurfacing group. Patellar nonresurfacing had higher lateral subluxation than resurfacing group according to radiological evaluation. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had 5.5 fold patellar related complication than patients with osteoarthritis. The 10-year survival rate was not statistically significant different between the two groups (P = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference of long-term clinical outcome and survivorship between patellar resurfacing and nonresurfacing.

OBJECTIVE: We test the hypothesis that subsets of airway MDRCs contribute differentially to the inflammatory milieu in human asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We used bronchoalveolar lavage to identify and characterize human airway MDRCs from 10 healthy subjects, 9 patients with mild asthma, and 8 patients with COPD, none of whom were treated with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. We defined subsets of airway MDRCs using flow cytometry, the molecular mediators they produce, and their abilities to regulate proliferation of polyclonally activated autologous T lymphocytes. RESULTS: We found substantial differences in the functional potential of MDRC subsets in healthy subjects, patients with asthma, and patients with COPD, with these differences regulated by the nitrosative and oxidative free radicals and cytokines they produced. Nitric oxide-producing MDRCs suppressed and superoxide-producing MDRCs enhanced proliferation of polyclonally activated autologous CD4 T cells. HLA-DR(+)CD11(+)CD11c(+)CD163(-) superoxide-producing MDRCs, which stimulated proliferation of autologous T cells, comprised a high fraction of MDRCs in the airways of patients with mild asthma or COPD but not those of healthy control subjects. CD11b(+)CD14(+)CD16(-)HLA-DR(-) nitric oxide-producing MDRCs, which suppressed T-cell proliferation, were present in high numbers in airways of patients with mild asthma but not patients with COPD or healthy control subjects. CONCLUSION: Subsets of airway MDRCs conclusively discriminate patients with mild asthma, patients with COPD, and healthy subjects from each other. The distinctive activities of these MDRCs in patients with asthma or COPD might provide novel targets for new therapeutics for these common disorders.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList"},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25420684","title":"Subsets of airway myeloid-derived regulatory cells distinguish mild asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","year":"2014"}

Longitudinal safety and cost have arisen as new concerns. The concept of a treatment holiday, drug discontinuation after achieving remission, may solve these problems. The authors performed a systematic literature review and identified 13 reports from 10 studies (TNF20, BeSt, OPITMA, HIT-HARD, IMPROVED, PRIZE, IDEA, EMPIRE, tREACH and AVERT) for early RA (≤2 years). Eight out of 13 reports (61.5%) were published in 2013 or 2014, indicating emerging interest in recent years. Also, the authors performed a sub-analysis of the HONOR study (n = 51) to compare early (≤2 years) and established RA. The proportions of remission (REM) and low disease activity were higher in early RA (REM: 63.0 vs 33.3%, p = 0.0346; low disease activity: 77.8 vs 45.8%, p = 0.0185). In conclusion, early intervention is beneficial for successful treatment holiday, which may lead to risk and cost reduction. However, further investigation is required.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Expert review of clinical pharmacology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Secondary Prevention","uri":{"id":"D055502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome","uri":{"id":"D009800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Early Intervention (Education)","uri":{"id":"D018479","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Antirheumatic Agents","uri":{"id":"D018501","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Classification","uri":{"id":"D002965","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Holidays","uri":{"id":"D006693","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Literature","uri":{"id":"D008091","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methotrexate","uri":{"id":"D008727","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publishing","uri":{"id":"D011643","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25420554","title":"Combination therapy for early rheumatoid arthritis: a treatment holiday perspective.","year":"2014"}

Sample one described the epidemiology and included patients admitted during a 2-year period with acute TSCI. Sample two included only patients with TSCI due to RTC.Results:Annual incidence was 13 per million population. Epidemiology of TSCI: 49 patients were included, 71% male, age ranging from 4 to 81 years, 80% ⩽45 years. Tetraplegia was more common than paraplegia (59/41%), and 39% had C1-C4 level of injury. The main cause of TSCI was RTC (68%), followed by assault (16%) and falls (10%). Mortality was 20%, where all, but one, had tetraplegia (18%). Median time from injury to spinal surgery was 12 days, with longer time for women, 16 days compared with 8 for men. Burst tire was the primary cause of RTC resulting in a TSCI, followed by hitting animals on the road. The majority had been passengers and 72% were involved in single crashes.Conclusion:The most common cause for TSCI was RTC, followed by assault. In-hospital mortality was high and the waiting period from the time of accident to spinal surgery was long, especially for women. The aetiology and high mortality of TSCI in Botswana indicate that improvements in roadway safety and medical care may decrease the TSCI incidence and mortality.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 25 November 2014; doi:10.1038/sc.2014.203.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Spinal cord","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Injuries","uri":{"id":"D013124","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals, Public","uri":{"id":"D006779","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Cord","uri":{"id":"D013116","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Spinal Cord Injuries","uri":{"id":"D013119","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospital Mortality","uri":{"id":"D017052","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Animals","uri":{"id":"D000818","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitalization","uri":{"id":"D006760","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hospitals","uri":{"id":"D006761","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Male","uri":{"id":"D008297","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Mortality","uri":{"id":"D009026","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Referral and Consultation","uri":{"id":"D012017","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Safety","uri":{"id":"D012449","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"General Surgery","uri":{"id":"D013502","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Wounds and Injuries","uri":{"id":"D014947","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Medicalization","uri":{"id":"D062528","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Botswana","uri":{"id":"D001902","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epidemiology","uri":{"id":"D004813","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Paraplegia","uri":{"id":"D010264","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quadriplegia","uri":{"id":"D011782","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25420494","title":"Traumatic spinal cord injury in Botswana: characteristics, aetiology and mortality.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Osteoclasts (OC), specialized cells derived from monocytes, maintain skeletal homeostasis under normal conditions but degrade bone in patients with rheumatoid (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Monocytes initially develop in the bone marrow (BM), circulate in peripheral blood, and differentiate into distinct cell types with diverse functions. Imaging studies in (RA) patients and murine arthritis models demonstrate that bone marrow edema detected on MRI is the result of enhanced myelopoiesis which precedes the development of bone erosions detected on plain radiographs several years later. A major knowledge gap, however, is whether OC develop in the BM and circulate to the joint and if the differentiation to OC takes place in the joint space in response to differentiation signals such as RANKL and TNF. We have previously demonstrated that osteoclast precursors (OCP) are increased in the circulaton of patients with RA and PsA. We showed that DC-STAMP (Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane protein), a 7-pass transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of monocytes, is essential for cell-to-cell fusion during OC differentiation and is a valid biomarker of OCP. Herein, we examined OCP in human bone marrow and identified one novel subset of DC-STAMP+CD45(intermediate) monocytes which was absent in the blood. We also found that OCPs reside in human BM with a higher frequency than in the peripheral blood. These findings support the notion that the BM is a major reservoir of circulating OCPs. In addition, we demonstrated that a higher frequency of DC-STAMP+ cells in the BM have detectable intracellular IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17A than DC-STAMP+ cells circulating in the peripheral blood. Finally, the frequency of DC-STAMP+ monocytes and T cells is signficantly higher in PsA BM compared to healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced myelopoiesis is a central event in inflammatory arthritis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of bone marrow research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Bone Marrow","uri":{"id":"D001853","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"T-Lymphocytes","uri":{"id":"D013601","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Psoriatic","uri":{"id":"D015535","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Dendrites","uri":{"id":"D003712","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Edema","uri":{"id":"D004487","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Homeostasis","uri":{"id":"D006706","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Internship and Residency","uri":{"id":"D007396","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Monocytes","uri":{"id":"D009000","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Proteins","uri":{"id":"D011506","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Specialization","uri":{"id":"D013038","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Knowledge","uri":{"id":"D019359","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interleukin-17","uri":{"id":"D020381","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Osteoclasts","uri":{"id":"D010010","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Interleukin-4","uri":{"id":"D015847","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Myelopoiesis","uri":{"id":"D038042","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419541","title":"Characterization of DC-STAMP+ Cells in Human Bone Marrow.","year":"2013"}

The efficiency and submaximal strain have not been established and thus cannot be compared with alternative common modes of exercise. A total of 22 healthy able-bodied men (n=10) and women (n=12) were enrolled in four discontinuous submaximal graded exercise tests. Each test consisted of seven bouts of 3 min exercise ranging from 20 to 45 W and was performed on, respectively, the Cruiser ergometer, a bicycle ergometer, a handbike, and again the Cruiser ergometer. Cardiorespiratory parameters were measured and rate of perceived exertion was determined. Gross mechanical efficiency (GE) was determined from power output and submaximal steady-state energy cost. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (P<0.05) was used to evaluate the effects of exercise mode, exercise intensity, and sex. No differences in GE and cardiorespiratory strain were found between both Cruiser tests (GE 45 W: men 13.0%, women 15%) and the bicycle test (GE 45 W: men 13.2%, women 14.6%). GEs of handbiking (45 W: men 11.2%, women 12.2%) were lower compared with the Cruiser and bicycle test results, whereas cardiorespiratory strain in handbiking was consistently higher. Apart from a lower rate of perceived exertion at the second Cruiser test, no differences were found between the repeated Cruiser tests. It can be concluded that GE and cardiorespiratory strain in submaximal Cruiser exercise are comparable with leg cycling, the repeatability was good, and no obvious learning effects were observed. The results of this study form a base for further research in patients with a lower limb amputation.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of rehabilitation research.

Urinary albumin leakage is a manifestation of generalized vascular damage. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a vasoactive peptide secreted by left ventricle in response to myocytic stretch. We aimed to investigate relationship between microalbuminuria (MA) and BNP in untreated elevated blood pressures. METHODS: Of 105 untreated prehypertensive subjects (53 men, 52 women), 100 hypertensive subjects (51 men, 49 women) and 57 normotensive subjects (32 men, 25 women) none had history of diabetes. Urine albumin excretion was measured by immunoradiometric assay in morning urine sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of MA was higher in hypertensive group than in prehypertensive group and in normotensive group (Hypertensive group; 33.9%, prehypertensive; 25.9%, normotensive; 10%). Subjects with HT had higher prevalence of microalbminuria; larger body mass index, higher levels of triglycerides, blood glucose and creatinin were more common in subjects with HT than in those with preHT. In hypertensive group; patients with microalbuminuria had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), BNP, LVMI and lower eGFR as compared to those without MA. MA was significantly correlated with LVMI, BNP and SBP. In multivariate regression analysis, SBP (β: 0.361; P < 0.001), LVMII (β: 0.267; P = 0.011) and BNP (β: 0.284; P = 0.005) were independent variables associated with MA in hypertensives. In prehypertensive group; patients with microalbuminuria had higher SBP, BNP, LVMI and lower eGFR as compared to those without MA. MA was significantly correlated with LVMI, BNP and SBP. In multivariate regression analysis, SBP (β: 0.264; P = 0.002), LVMI (β: 0.293; P = 0.001) and BNP (β: 0.168; P = 0.045) were associated with MA in prehypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: In preHT and HT, SBP, BNP and LVMI are associated with MA. In the evaluation of increased blood pressures, in case of increased BNP and LVMI, MA should be investigated even in prehypertensive stages. The subjects with increased blood pressures should get medical treatment to prevent the effects on vascular structure and myocardium even in prehypertensive phase.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"International journal of clinical and experimental

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of variants associated with a risk for autoimmune and immune-related disorders (AID), our understanding of the disease mechanisms is still limited. In particular, more than 90% of the risk variants lie in non-coding regions, and almost 10% of these map to long non-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are known to show more cell-type specificity than protein-coding genes. METHODS: We aimed to characterize lncRNAs and protein-coding genes located in loci associated with nine AIDs which have been well-defined by Immunochip analysis and by transcriptome analysis across seven populations of peripheral blood leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, memory T cells, naive CD4(+) and naive CD8(+) T cells) and four populations of cord blood-derived T-helper cells (precursor, primary, and polarized (Th1, Th2) T-helper cells). RESULTS: We show that lncRNAs mapping to loci shared between AID are significantly enriched in immune cell types compared to lncRNAs from the whole genome (α <0.005). We were not able to prioritize single cell types relevant for specific diseases, but we observed five different cell types enriched (α <0.005) in five AID (NK cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and psoriasis; memory T and CD8(+) T cells in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis; Th0 and Th2 cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis). Furthermore, we show that co-expression analyses of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes can predict the signaling pathways in which these AID-associated lncRNAs are involved. CONCLUSIONS: The observed enrichment of lncRNA transcripts in AID loci implies lncRNAs play an important role in AID etiology and suggests that lncRNA genes should be studied in more detail to interpret GWAS findings correctly. The co-expression results strongly support a model in which the lncRNA and protein-coding genes function together in the same pathways.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Genome

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Boswellic acids (BAs) show anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and asthma. A topical administration route is currently used to deliver active compounds in psoriatic and eczematous patients. In this double-blind study we compare a novel BA formulation (containing Bosexil(®), INCI [International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients]: lecithin, Boswellia serrata resin extract) with a placebo formulation. A third arm of the trial received a formulation of Vaccinium myrtillus seed oil, previously demonstrated as an effective local treatment for psoriatic lesions. METHODS: Patients with psoriasis or erythematous eczema were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to Bosexil(®), V. myrtillus seed oil, or placebo. In order to evaluate the effects of treatment, the changes of scales and erythema from diagnosis to the end of treatment were scored in psoriatic patients, while changes in itch and erythema were analyzed for erythematous eczema patients. Psoriasis Area Severity Index and Eczema Area and Severity Index scores were also calculated. RESULTS: In patients with psoriasis, scales and erythema improved both with Bosexil(®) and the V. myrtillus seed oil treatment in comparison with placebo. In particular, the treatment with Bosexil(®) formulation improved scales (70% of cases) and erythema (50% of cases) without any case of worsening. In patients with eczema, the administration of placebo did not result in any improvement in 90% of cases, and in the remaining 10% worsened both itch and erythema. Bosexil(®) formulation improved both itch (60% of cases) and erythema (60% of cases) without any case of worsening. V. myrtillus seed oil improved itch and erythema in 66.7% and 77.8% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: A topical formulation of Bosexil(®) may be promising for the treatment of psoriasis and erythematous eczema. Long-term studies are recommended to evaluate the adherence to this topical treatment and its clinical benefits in real life.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Treatment Outcome","uri":{"id":"D016896","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Administration, Topical","uri":{"id":"D000287","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Double-Blind Method","uri":{"id":"D004311","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Boswellia","uri":{"id":"D029743","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccinium myrtillus","uri":{"id":"D029800","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Abstracting and Indexing as Topic","uri":{"id":"D000043","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents","uri":{"id":"D000893","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Asthma","uri":{"id":"D001249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cosmetics","uri":{"id":"D003358","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Erythema","uri":{"id":"D004890","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pruritus","uri":{"id":"D011537","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Life","uri":{"id":"D019369","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Eczema","uri":{"id":"D004485","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Osteoarthritis","uri":{"id":"D010003","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psoriasis","uri":{"id":"D011565","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Boswellia","uri":{"id":"D029743","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccinium","uri":{"id":"D029796","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Lecithins","uri":{"id":"D054709","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419153","title":"A cosmeceutical formulation based on boswellic acids for the treatment of erythematous eczema and psoriasis.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"BACKGROUND: Decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in enhanced stress responses. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with psychological changes; for example, carriers of the Met allele exhibit increased harm avoidance as well as a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder. METHODS: To analyze the effects of BDNF Val66Met on stress responses, we tested 226 university students (88 women and 138 men) using a social stress procedure (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]) and an electrical stimulation stress test. Stress indices were derived from repeated measurements of salivary α-amylase, salivary cortisol, heart rate, and psychological testing during the stress tests. All subjects were genotyped for the Val66Met polymorphism (G196A). RESULTS: A significant three-way interaction (time [3 levels] × BDNF [Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met]; P<0.05) was demonstrated that revealed different salivary cortisol responses in the TSST but not in electrical stimulation. Met/Met women had stronger cortisol responses than Val/Met and Val/Val individuals in the TSST. Met/Met men exhibited stronger salivary cortisol responses than Val/Met and Val/Val individuals in the TSST. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a common, functionally significant polymorphism in BDNF had different effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity but not on sympathetic adrenomedullary reactivity in TSST and electrical stimulation tests.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety Disorders","uri":{"id":"D001008","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heart Rate","uri":{"id":"D006339","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Nerve Growth Factors","uri":{"id":"D009414","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor","uri":{"id":"D019208","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Electric Stimulation","uri":{"id":"D004558","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Exercise Test","uri":{"id":"D005080","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Psychological Tests","uri":{"id":"D011581","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Alleles","uri":{"id":"D000483","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Anxiety","uri":{"id":"D001007","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Axis","uri":{"id":"D001368","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Depression","uri":{"id":"D003863","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Genotype","uri":{"id":"D005838","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hydrocortisone","uri":{"id":"D006854","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Methods","uri":{"id":"D008722","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Physics","uri":{"id":"D010825","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialism","uri":{"id":"D012950","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Socialization","uri":{"id":"D012951","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Students","uri":{"id":"D013334","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Universities","uri":{"id":"D014495","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor","uri":{"id":"D019208","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25419135","title":"Association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with HPA and SAM axis reactivity to psychological and physical stress.","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Objective: The association of HLA-B27 with spondyloarthropathy is one of the strongest documented for any autoimmune disease. A common hypothesis for this association is the arthritogenic peptide concept. This dictates that differences in the peptide binding preferences of disease associated and non-associated HLA-B27 allotypes underpin the presentation of bacterial and self-peptides leading to cross-reactive T cell immunity and subsequent autoimmune attack of affected tissues. Methods: Qualitative differences in the peptides bound to the 8 most frequent HLA-B27 subtypes were determined by tandem mass spectrometry and quantitative changes in allelic binding specificities determined by highly sensitive and targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Results: Here we identify over 7500 MHC class I peptides derived from the 8 most common HLA-B27 allotypes, HLA-B*27:02 to HLA-B*27:09. We describe individual binding motifs for these alleles for 9-12 mer ligands. The peptide repertoires of these closely related alleles show significant overlap. Allelic polymorphism resulting in changes in the amino acid composition of the antigen binding cleft manifests largely as quantitative changes in the peptide cargo of these molecules. Conclusion: Absolute binding preferences do not explain disease association.

Active research in recent years has led to tremendous progress in our understanding of the biology and genetics, and marked improvement in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Gleason grading has remained as the cornerstone for management of patients with prostate cancer. However, the grading system has continuously evolving since its inception in response to changes in the clinical practice of diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The modification of Gleason grading system implemented by the International Society of Urological Pathology in 2005 has profoundly changed the way prostate cancer is graded and consequently how patients are managed. Several prostate cancer histological types with distinct clinical and pathological features have been rediscovered or redefined. Finally, elucidations of the molecular and genetic mechanism helps not only better understand the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, but also identify biomarkers for improved diagnosis, risk stratification and clinical management. This article briefly reviews the most recent advances in the Gleason grading system, new histological types and molecular genetics of prostate cancer.Keywords: prostate - Gleason grade - intraductal carcinoma - neuroendocrine differentiation - molecular genetics.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Ceskoslovenska patologie","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Typing","uri":{"id":"D058889","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developing Countries","uri":{"id":"D003906","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatic Neoplasms","uri":{"id":"D011471","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Developed Countries","uri":{"id":"D019049","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating","uri":{"id":"D002285","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Molecular Biology","uri":{"id":"D008967","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research","uri":{"id":"D012106","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine","uri":{"id":"D018278","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neoplasm Grading","uri":{"id":"D060787","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biology","uri":{"id":"D001695","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Carcinoma","uri":{"id":"D002277","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathology","uri":{"id":"D010336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostate","uri":{"id":"D011467","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatitis","uri":{"id":"D011472","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Societies","uri":{"id":"D012952","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Biological Markers","uri":{"id":"D015415","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Incidence","uri":{"id":"D015994","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prostatism","uri":{"id":"D053448","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25418898","title":"A concise update on prostate pathology.","year":"2014"}

The aim of the study is to describe the socio-epidemiological, clinical and microbiology / molecular epidemiology of HIV / AIDS infection in the immigrant population. METHODS: Review of the literature following the methodology Scoping review. A literature search in Medline and MEDES, original items made in Spain, published between 1998-2012, with people from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, Asia and / or Eastern Europe was conducted. RESULTS: 41 articles were selected. The most studied population was from Latin America (48.8%). Higher HIV prevalence than in native was observed in men who have sex with men from Latin America (18.1%), transvestite and transsexual sex workers from Latin America (23.3%), pregnant women (0.9%) and men and women from sub-Saharan Africa (9.1% and 7.5%). Risk behaviors were different depending on the country of origin and sex. The diagnostic delay of HIV infections reached 43%, with higher prevalence in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, which showed delayed diagnosis in 41% and resistance to anti-retroviral treatment in 13%. Immigrant women had more losses to follow up, worse immunological response to antiretroviral treatment and shorter time treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of HIV is presented by subjects from sub-Saharan Africa, men who have sex with men and transgender and transvestite sex workers from Latin America. Also pregnant women. Delayed diagnosis and resistance to treatment are more common in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa. Immigrant women presented poorer response to antiretroviral treatment.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Revista española de salud

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Objectives: Family history of RA is one of the strongest risk factors for developing RA, and is therefore routinely collected in clinical practice. However, as more genetic and environmental risk factors shared by relatives are identified, the importance of family history might diminish. We aimed to test how much of the RA familial risk could be explained by established genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Methods: RA disease history in first degree relatives of individuals in the EIRA case-control study was assessed through linkage to the Swedish Multi-Generation and Patient registers. We used logistic regression models to investigate the decrease in familial risk after successive adjustment for combinations of non-genetic (smoking, alcohol intake, parity, silica exposure, BMI, fatty fish consumption, socio-economic status) and genetic (shared epitope (SE) and 76 SNPs) risk factors. Results: Established non-genetic risk factors did not explain any significant part of the familial risk in either seropositive or -negative RA. Genetic risk factors explained a limited proportion of the familial risk for seropositive RA (Family history ORCrude =4.10, ORAdjusted for SE =3.72, ORAdjusted for 76SNPs =3.46, ORAdjusted for both =3.35). Conclusion: Established risk factors only explained a minor part of the familial risk of RA, suggesting that many (and familial) risk factors remain to be identified, in particular for seronegative RA. Family history of RA thus remains an important clinical risk factor for RA that currently cannot be substituted with other information. There is thus a need for further etiologic studies in both seropositive and seronegative RA. © 2014 American College of Rheumatology.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Risk Factors","uri":{"id":"D012307","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Logistic Models","uri":{"id":"D016015","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Case-Control Studies","uri":{"id":"D016022","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Social Class","uri":{"id":"D012923","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Epitopes","uri":{"id":"D000939","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"History","uri":{"id":"D006664","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Organization and Administration","uri":{"id":"D009934","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Parity","uri":{"id":"D010298","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","uri":{"id":"D020641","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Minors","uri":{"id":"D033242","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Family","uri":{"id":"D005190","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Rheumatology","uri":{"id":"D012219","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Silicon Dioxide","uri":{"id":"D012822","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25418518","title":"To which extent may the familial risk of rheumatoid arthritis be explained by established RA risk factors?","year":"2014"}
{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Objective: This systematic review examined the impact of anti-rheumatic drugs on bone mineral density (BMD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis. Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials. Studies were grouped based on disease, treatment, and site of BMD measurement. Change in BMD (∆BMD) from baseline to end-of-study was recorded. Standardized mean difference (SMD) of ∆BMD between treatment and controls was standardized for meta-analyses and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated. Results: Treatment effects on BMD were not the primary outcomes of the trials. Thirteen studies were eligible (11 RA, 2 AS, 0 psoriatic arthritis, 0 psoriasis). For RA, significantly less hand bone loss was seen with TNF inhibitors (TNFi) (SMD ∆BMD=0.33, CI 0.13-0.53, p=0.001, I(2) =0%) and glucocorticoids (SMD ∆BMD=0.51, CI 0.20-0.81, p=0.001, I(2) =0%). TNFi had no significant effect on lumbar spine (LS) and hip BMD. Glucocorticoids were associated with a negative effect on LS (SMD ∆BMD=-0.30, CI -0.55to-0.04, p=0.02, I(2) =52%) but not hip BMD. For AS, a significant increase in BMD was seen with TNFi at LS (SMD ∆BMD=0.96, CI 0.64-1.27, p<0.001, I(2) =16%) and hip (SMD ∆BMD=0.38, 95% CI 0.13-0.62, p=0.003, I(2) =0%). Data were insufficient to perform meta-analyses in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis or for other anti-rheumatic drugs. Conclusion: In RA, TNFi and glucocorticoids appeared to attenuate hand bone loss. TNFi did not impact LS and hip BMD and glucocorticoids had negative effects on LS and no effect on hip BMD. In AS, TNFi was associated with improved LS and hip BMD. This article is protected by copyright.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Increasing evidence is showing that the non-neuronal cholinergic system plays an important role in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Choline transport into the cell is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh), which can be released directly or in vesicles from the cell. However, in the human joint little is known about choline import or the release of ACh from the cell. Thus, we analyze the expression of members of the organic cation transporter (OCT), of the newly discovered choline transporter-like (CTL) family and of classical neuronal components such as the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1) and the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) in the synovium and cartilage of the human hip joint from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA. OCT1, OCT3 and OCTN1 and all members of the CTL family were expressed in synovial and cartilage samples. The expression of CTL1 and CTL2 was localized in synovial macrophages and fibroblasts. CHT1 mRNA expression was detectable only in the synovium, whereas VAChT was completely absent in all samples. Therefore, in the human joint, choline transport into the cell and the release of ACh seems to be mediated mainly by members of the OCT and CTL family. Expression of transporters appears not to be influenced by the pathological state, as no differences have been detected between joints from OA or RA patients. Importantly, however, all necessary components for choline import and the release of non-neuronal ACh are present in the human joint.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Cell and tissue research","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","uri":{"id":"D001172","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hip Joint","uri":{"id":"D006621","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Arthritis","uri":{"id":"D001168","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cartilage","uri":{"id":"D002356","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cations","uri":{"id":"D002412","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fibroblasts","uri":{"id":"D005347","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Macrophages","uri":{"id":"D008264","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Neurons","uri":{"id":"D009474","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pain","uri":{"id":"D010146","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pathology","uri":{"id":"D010336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"RNA, Messenger","uri":{"id":"D012333","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Acetylcholine","uri":{"id":"D000109","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Choline","uri":{"id":"D002794","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Osteoarthritis","uri":{"id":"D010003","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Synovial Membrane","uri":{"id":"D013583","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cholinergic Agents","uri":{"id":"D018678","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25418136","title":"Expression of choline and acetylcholine transporters in synovial tissue and cartilage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.","year":"2014"}

Despite the fact that floods are the most common and most destructive natural disaster worldwide, little is known about their effect on human health. We analyzed the influence of the greatest floods in the Czech Republic on cardiac mortality in the affected area. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study. We analyzed persons whose autopsies proved they had died of cardiac causes during the month of the flood, 2 months before the flood, 1 month after the flood, and during the same period in the 3 previous years. RESULTS: A total of 207 of 985 autopsy reports met the criteria for inclusion in the study. There were no significant differences in the proportions of men and women (P=0.819) or in age (P=0.577). During the month of the flood, an increase in cardiac mortality was observed; however, the increase was not statistically significant (P=0.088).

European Centre Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) introduced enhanced surveillance of hepatitis B at EU/EEA level in 2011 to collate routine surveillance data from national notification systems. Analysis of the data collected for the years 2006-2012 shows a high burden of hepatitis B across Europe with 110 005 cases reported over the period with the majority of these cases being chronic infections. The most commonly reported routes of transmission in acute cases included heterosexual transmission, nosocomial transmission, injecting drug use and transmission among men who have sex with men. Mother-to-child transmission was the most common route reported for chronic cases. Trends over time were difficult to analyse as national reporting practices changed, but data suggest a downward trend in acute cases, which probably reflects the impact of the widespread implementation of vaccination programmes. Notifications of chronic infection varied across countries and showed discrepancy with the expected results based on findings from recent prevalence surveys. This indicated that notifications mirror local testing practices rather than real occurrence of disease. Improving the quality of the data and considering reported notifications alongside other data sources, such as local screening practices and vaccination policies, will improve the utility of the data.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of viral hepatitis","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Quality Improvement","uri":{"id":"D058996","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Public Health","uri":{"id":"D011634","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis B","uri":{"id":"D006509","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Data Collection","uri":{"id":"D003625","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Pharmaceutical Preparations","uri":{"id":"D004364","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Europe","uri":{"id":"D005060","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Hepatitis","uri":{"id":"D006505","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Probability","uri":{"id":"D011336","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Publications","uri":{"id":"D011642","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccination","uri":{"id":"D014611","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Vaccines","uri":{"id":"D014612","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Prevalence","uri":{"id":"D015995","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Research Report","uri":{"id":"D058028","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Injections","uri":{"id":"D007267","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Heterosexuality","uri":{"id":"D020010","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417854","title":"Enhanced surveillance of hepatitis B in the EU, 2006-2012.","year":"2014"}

Methods: Synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis patients were examined for the presence of MAA-modified and citrullinated proteins. Anti-MAA antibody isotypes were measured in RA cases (n = 1720) and healthy controls (n = 80) by ELISA. Antigen-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) was measured in RA cases using a multiplex antigen array. Anti-MAA isotype concentrations were compared in a subset of cases (n = 80) and matched controls (n = 80). Associations of anti-MAA antibody isotypes with disease characteristics, including ACPA, were examined in all RA cases. Results: MAA adducts were increased in RA synovial tissues relative to osteoarthritis and co-localized with citrullinated protein. Anti-MAA antibody isotypes were increased in RA cases vs. controls (p < 0.001). Among RA cases, anti-MAA antibody isotypes were associated with ACPA and RF positivity (p < 0.001) in addition to select measures of disease activity. Higher anti-MAA antibody concentrations were associated with a higher number of positive antigen-specific ACPA analytes in high titer (p < 0.001) and a higher ACPA score (p < 0.001) independent of other covariates. Conclusion: MAA adduct formation is increased in RA and appears to result in robust antibody responses that are strongly associated with ACPA. These results support speculation that MAA formation may be a co-factor that drives tolerance loss resulting in the autoimmune responses characteristic of RA. This article is protected by copyright.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Objective. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common highly heritable immune mediated arthropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to an unknown but likely ubiquitous environmental trigger. There is a close relationship between the gut and SpA, exemplified in reactive arthritis patients where a typically self-limiting arthropathy follows either gastrointestinal or urogenital infection. Microbial involvement has been suggested in AS, however, no definitive link has been established. We sought to determine if the AS gut carries a distinct microbial signature, in comparison to healthy controls (HC). Methods. Microbial profiles from terminal ileal (TI) biopsies from subjects with recent-onset, TNF-antagonist naïve AS and HC, were generated using culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis techniques. Results. Our results show the TI microbial communities of patients with AS differ significantly (P<0.001) from HC, driven by higher abundance of five families of bacteria Lachnospiraceae (P=0.001), Veillonellaceae (P=0.01), Prevotellaceae (P=0.004), Porphyromonadaceae (P=0.001), and Bacteroidaceae (P=0.001); two of which, Lachnospiracecae, and Prevotellaceace, have been strongly associated with colitis and CD. Conclusions. We show evidence for a discrete microbial signature in the TI of cases with AS compared to HC. The microbial composition was found to correlate with disease status and greater differences were observed between than within disease groups. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that genes associated with AS act at least in part through effects on the gut microbiome. This article is protected by copyright.

Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate EMF from other restrictive cardiomyopathies. Cur- rently, echocardiography is used for the initial investigations that might lead to a diagnosis of EMF. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging as an alternative noninvasive diagnostic tool. Twenty- eight patients (17 men and 11 women; aged 51.9 +/- 13.5 years), who were diagnosed as having restrictive cardiomyopathy after comprehensive echocardiography, underwent CMR imaging with the standard cardiomyopathy protocol. EMF was diagnosed in seven (25%) of these patients. Five patients with EMF had bi-ventricular involvement and one each had right and left ventricular involvement. Myocardial edema indicating acute inflammation was seen in one (14.3%) patient. Apical thrombus was seen in four (57.1%) cases. Subendocardial delayed enhancement was always present in the involved ventricles. Our results show that CMR imaging with late gadolinium enhancement can clearly detect the common hallmarks of EMF: endocardial fibrous tissue and obliteration of the involved ventricular apex.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging","uri":{"id":"D008279","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","uri":{"id":"D009682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive","uri":{"id":"D002313","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Endomyocardial Fibrosis","uri":{"id":"D004719","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Diagnosis","uri":{"id":"D003933","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Echocardiography","uri":{"id":"D004452","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Edema","uri":{"id":"D004487","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Evaluation Studies as Topic","uri":{"id":"D005069","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Fibrosis","uri":{"id":"D005355","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Gadolinium","uri":{"id":"D005682","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Inflammation","uri":{"id":"D007249","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Men","uri":{"id":"D008571","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cardiomyopathies","uri":{"id":"D009202","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Patients","uri":{"id":"D010361","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Thrombosis","uri":{"id":"D013927","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Tissues","uri":{"id":"D014024","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Women","uri":{"id":"D014930","namespace":"MeSH:"}}]},"meshHeading":null,"pmid":"25417517","title":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of endomyocardial fibrosis.","year":"2014"}

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"UNLABELLED: Until now, research on sexual behavior and HIV in Israel has been carried out mainly on the general population, and focused primarily on defining populations at risk, without adequate consideration given to the reasons bringing these populations to be tested, and their specific sexual behaviors. In Israel, one can choose whether to take an HIV test in confidential centers (giving one's name under medical confidentiality) or in anonymous centers (Israel AIDS Task Force in Tel Aviv and Beer Sheva, Levinsky Clinic in Tel Aviv and Haparsim Clinic in Haifa]. At least 21% of the clients of the anonymous testing centers in Israel belong to a high risk population in contrast to 2.6% in confidential clinics, and so, in this study, we hypothesize that characterization of sexual behavior patterns in anonymous testing centers might enable us to better characterize sexual behavior patterns in high risk populations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used questionnaires distributed in the clinics by the Israel AIDS Task Force in order to characterize their clinic's clients. The questionnaires were completed by the Israel AIDS Task Force consultants during the consultation period at which the anonymous test was performed. Data collected included: gender, age, testing history, specific sexual behaviors and reasons for applying for the current test. RESULTS: A total of 926 questionnaires were collected; 29.9% of them were of female patients. The average age was 29.47 years (1±8.66]; 21.3% of the clients were men who have sex with men [MSM]; only 2.3% of the clients belonged to other high risk populations. In all groups, the majority of the patients reported high risk sexual behavior (any sexual contact without a condom) and the average age for the first test was much higher than the average age of first sexual intercourse common in Israel. Women reported more participation in unprotected vaginal intercourse than heterosexual men, and a substantial part of MSM reported performing unprotected anal intercourse. More heterosexuals than MSM stated a new relationship as a reason for applying for the test, and more MSM than heterosexuals reported arriving for a routine check-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for comprehensive programs encouraging testing for HIV in all age groups, focusing on Sthe ages 18-25 years, and encouraging the use of a condom as a preventive measure in all populations, especially women. We feel it is essential to emphasize the need for educational programs tailored for each sub-population's psychosocial characteristics and specific issues.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Harefuah","meshAnnotations":{"@type":"java.util.ArrayList","@items":[{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Coitus","uri":{"id":"D003075","namespace":"MeSH:"}},{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$MeshAnnotation","termLabel":"Cross-Sectional

METHODS: Three-hundred RA patients were divided randomly into a treatment group (n = 150) and control group (n = 150). A normal control (NC) group (n = 90) was also created. Changes in cardiac function, pulmonary function, anemia indices and platelet parameters of RA patients were measured. Curative effects of the two groups were compared, and comparison carried out with the NC group. RESULTS: In 300 RA patients, late diastolic peak flow velocity (A peak) was much higher (P < 0.01) and early diastolic peak flow velocity (E peak), E/A, and left ventricular fraction shortening much lower(P < 0.01) than those in the NC group. Vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity in one second, forced vitalcapacity (FVC), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal expiratory flow in 50% of VC (FEF50) and FEF75 were lowered remarkably (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Platelet count (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT) and mean platelet volume (MPV) increased markedly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and hemoglobin (Hb) level decreased significantly (P < 0.05). After XFC treatment, the A peak and PLT and PCT were much lower (P < 0.05), and E/A and the number of red blood cells as well as Hb level were much higher (P < 0.05), as were FVC, MVV and FEF50 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), in the treatment group than those in the NC group. Total score of pain and swelling in joints, uric-acid level and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were much lower, and superoxide dismutase level as well as the number of CD4 + CD25+ regulation T cells (Treg) and CD4+ CD25+ CD127- Treg were much higher (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the treatment group than those in the NC group. CONCLUSION: RA patients with pathologic changes in joints also suffer from lower cardiac and pulmonary functions and from parameters of anemia and platelet factors. XFC can improve the symptoms of RA patients, ameliorate their cardiac and pulmonary functions and reduce the parameters of anemia and platelet factors. XFC lowers the immune inflammatory reaction to improve APCs in RA patients.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan / sponsored by

The treatment is not clearly described in literature. It is recommended to start with systemic steroids and speech therapy.

{"@type":"edu.cmu.lti.oaqa.bio.bioasq.services.PubMedSearchServiceResponse$Document","documentAbstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors of skin necrosis around incision after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and explore the measures of prevention and treatment. METHODS: Between June 2007 and June 2013,7 patients with skin necrosis around incision after TKA were treated. There were 5 males and 2 females with an average age of 69 years (range, 59-78 years), including osteoarthritis in 4 cases, traumatic arthritis in 2 cases, and rheumatoid arthritis in 1 case. Two cases complicated by diabetes, and 2 cases by hypertension; 1 case received long-term hormone therapy; and 2 cases had a history of smoking. Scar was seen near knee joint in 2 cases. The skin necrosis ranged from 10 cm x 2 cm to 13 cm x 8 cm. The time from TKA to debridement was 7-15 days (mean, 12 days). After thorough debridement, the saphenous artery skin flap, medial head of gastrocnemius muscle flap, lateral head of gastrocnemius muscle flap were used in 4 cases, 2 cases, and 1 case respectively; reconstruction of patellar ligament was performed in 2 cases. Donor sites were repaired by split-thickness skin graft. RESULTS: All the flaps and myocutaneous flaps survived well, and all wounds healed by first intention. At donor site, the grafted skins survived and wounds healed by first intention. No early complication occurred. All cases were followed up 6-12 months (mean, 7.8 months). The flaps and myocutaneous flaps had good texture and appearance; no prosthetic loosening and displacement happened, no secondary infection was observed after operation. The knee range of motion was 45-110 degrees (mean, 85 degrees) at 6 months after operation. According to the Knee Society Score (KSS), the results were excellent in 3 cases, good in 2 cases, general in 1 case, and poor in 1 case at 6 months after operation. CONCLUSION: Early discovery, thoroughly debridement, and timely repair with axial pattern flap or myocutaneous flap are the key factors to treat skin necrosis around incision after TKA and save the artificial prosthesis.","fulltextAvailable":false,"journal":"Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive
